"""agent_defs.py — the STATIC CAP CHECK on every worker definition (GitHub #172, slice S4).

Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-177, `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-177)"): workers are
named definitions under `.claude/agents/`, at most Opus-class, effort at most `xhigh` (the
maintainer's #172 ask). MEASURED the same sitting (`tools/agent/probe_agents.sh`): a definition
with no `model` or no `effort` runs at its CALLER's (A9, A4) — which S5 makes Fable — and a
`hooks:` block in the frontmatter did not fire (A6). So every definition must STATE its caps, and
must not carry a key that reads as enforcement and is not. The call-side half (the Agent call's
`model` beats the definition's, A2) is the call gate's, not this tool's.

Each `<dir>/*.md` must have a frontmatter block (`---` ... `---`) with EXACTLY these keys:
  name         equal to the file's stem
  description  non-empty
  model        opus | sonnet | haiku, or a claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-<version> id
               (never omitted, never `inherit`, never Fable)
  effort       low | medium | high | xhigh   (never omitted, never `max`)
  tools        a comma-separated list, every entry in ALLOWED_TOOLS (never omitted: an omitted
               list grants every tool — documented, not measured)
and ONE optional key:
  omitClaudeMd exactly `true` (14z-178: MEASURED by probe_agents.sh A13 to launch the worker with
               no CLAUDE.md in its context — no instructions attachment, and the CLAUDE.md
               codeword unnamed — where every definition without it, and every general-purpose
               call, receives CLAUDE.md; any other value reads as a setting and is refused)
Any other key (`hooks`, `permissionMode`, `disallowedTools`, `mcpServers`, ...) is refused: a
new key is a reviewed widening of this list, never a silent one. And every name in REQUIRED
must be present; a name in PINNED_MODEL must name a version id, never an alias (#158); a name in
CONTEXT_FREE must carry `omitClaudeMd: true` — the rule-checker is
context-free by ruling (2026-09-23, 14z-175: "a generic checklist plus a transcript extract,
never CLAUDE.md"). The body (the worker's prompt) must be non-empty.

Usage:
  python3 tools/agent/agent_defs.py [DIR]      # default .claude/agents; exit 0 all OK, 1 any BAD
Prints one line per definition (OK / BAD <reasons>) and a count line. Stdlib only.
