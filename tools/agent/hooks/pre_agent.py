"""pre_agent.py — the CALL GATE of GitHub #172 slice S4: a worker runs at its caps.
A Claude Code PreToolUse hook on `Agent|Task` (wired in `.claude/settings.json` beside
`pre_bash.py` and `pre_push.py`; spec `docs/project/agent_architecture_scope.md` §4 W).

Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-177, `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-177)"): workers are at
most Opus-class — the maintainer's #172 ask. MEASURED the same sitting
(`tools/agent/probe_agents.sh`): the Agent call's `model` BEATS the definition's (A2), a call to
no definition with no `model` runs on the CALLER's model (A9) — which S5 makes Fable — and a
project hook on Agent sees the call's input and can deny it (A8). The definitions themselves are
held by `tests/test_agent_defs.sh`; this hook holds the CALL. It DENIES an Agent call that

  (a) passes a `model` above Opus-class (anything but opus / sonnet / haiku or a
      claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)-<version> id);
  (b) passes a `model` to a DEFINED worker (`.claude/agents/<subagent_type>.md` exists): the
      definition is the cap of record, and the call would beat it;
  (c) names no definition and passes no `model` — it would run on the orchestrator's model —
      unless the type is a BUILT-IN measured to stay at most Opus-class under a caller ABOVE it
      (SELF_CAPPED below; `tools/agent/probe_agents.sh` A11: under a Fable 5.1 parent with no
      model, `Explore` ran on Opus 5.5 while `general-purpose` ran on Fable 5.1). Measured over
      the archive too: every `general-purpose` (139) and `Plan` (5) call without a model ran on
      its parent's model — 56 of them on Fable 5.1 — and `Explore` on Opus 5 under Fable parents.
      `Explore` is NOT "its own model": under a Sonnet parent it ran on Sonnet (A11's first form
      FAILED on that premise); it follows the caller, capped at Opus-class, which is all this
      rule needs. `claude-code-guide` does not exist in a headless run, so it cannot be probed
      and is not listed;
  (d) calls a defined worker whose definition is driven by the spec template (its body names
      `docs/project/worker_spec.md`) with a prompt missing one of the template's headings —
      so a spec cannot skip the template.

A FORK (`subagent_type: "fork"`) is ALLOWED: ruled *"Allow forks"* — a fork is the orchestrator
continuing, not a spec'd worker. The reason always names the allowed form, so the task is redone
and the session goes on (the 2026-09-23 ruling: a block binds the task at fault, never the
session).

FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN, as `pre_bash.py`: an internal error ALLOWS the call and appends a line to
`build/agent_hooks/errors.log`.
