"""pre_bash.py — C0.1 of GitHub #172: no invisible jobs. A Claude Code PreToolUse hook
on Bash (wired in `.claude/settings.json`; spec `docs/project/agent_architecture_scope.md`).

It DENIES a Bash call that
  - detaches a job the harness cannot track (`nohup`, `setsid`, `disown`, or a
    backgrounding `&` with no later `wait`) — such a job can never produce a completion
    notification, so once the agent ends its turn nothing wakes it: the 14z-174 failure,
    where all twelve long jobs were `nohup` launches and eleven idle gaps ended only when
    the maintainer asked for status; or
  - waits in a loop conditioned on `pgrep`, which can match its own shell and never exit
    (4 h 12 min lost at 14z-159).
The reason names the tracked alternative, so the TASK is redone in the allowed form and
the session goes on (the maintainer's ruling of 2026-09-23: a block binds the task at
fault, never the session). `run_in_background: true` does not exempt a detach: the
tracked shell would end at once and leave the detached child as invisible as before.

FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN: any internal error ALLOWS the call and appends a line to
`build/agent_hooks/errors.log`, because a hook bug must not stop the work; the gate
`tests/test_agent_hooks.sh` is what keeps the logic from dying silently.
The classifier is `tools/agent/agentlib.py`, shared with the census that justified it.
