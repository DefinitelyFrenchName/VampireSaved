# GOTCHAS — traps that cost real debugging time

Append the moment one is paid for. Read before touching the related area.

## CPS-2 ROM file byte order is NOT 68k logical order (paid: 2026-07-25, ~1h)

The 16-bit words in the dumped program ROM files are stored **low-byte-first**.
MAME's `cps2_decrypt` operates on the `uint16` values you get from reading the
file little-endian (that's what the region layout gives it on a little-endian
host), NOT on big-endian words. Interpreting the files big-endian and
decrypting "works" (self-consistent, round-trips) but produces garbage that is
deceptively half-right: byte-symmetric words like `0x0000` decrypt identically
either way, and the 68k vector table alternates `0x00xx`/`0xxx00` words, so a
spot check of the first bytes shows a plausible mix of matches. **Symptom to
recognize:** a diff against a known-good image where "every other word
matches" in vector/data areas.

Project conventions locked in after this (see tools/cps2_decrypt.py header):
- ROM **files**: word = little-endian byte pair (as dumped).
- Raw **images** (opcode view, data view, MAME Lua dumps): 68k logical order,
  big-endian words — what the CPU and a disassembler see.
- The decrypt oracle test (tests/test_decrypt_oracle.sh) pins all of this
  against MAME's opcode space; run it after touching any byte-order code.

## MAME `logerror` output needs `-log`, not `-verbose` (paid: 2026-07-25)

`-verbose` only shows OSD chatter. Driver `logerror()` lines (e.g. cps2's
`cps2 decrypt <key0>,<key1>,<lower>,<upper>`) go to `error.log` in the
working directory only when `-log` is passed. That line is the fastest way to
get the authoritative key/range for a set.

## FBNeo fresh builds need `SKIPDEPEND=1` (paid: 2026-07-25)

`make sdl2` on a fresh clone dies with `No rule to make target 'driverlist.h',
needed by 'burn.d'` — the depend-generation path (DEPEND=1 default) wants the
generated `driverlist.h` via a bare-name prerequisite that vpath can't resolve
before the file exists. FBNeo's own CI never builds that path: every workflow
passes `SKIPDEPEND=1`. Use `make sdl2 SKIPDEPEND=1 -j8`. (Consequence: no
header-change tracking — after editing FBNeo headers, `make clean` or touch
the affected .cpp files.)

## FBNeo shared EEPROM breaks run-to-run determinism (paid: 2026-07-25, ~45min)

Symptom: consecutive scripted FBNeo runs of vsavj diverged from frame ~75 by
exactly ONE work-RAM byte (`RAM:$FF0CC9`) whose value differed by 1 — the
game's EEPROM bootup counter. Cause chain: (a) `$HOME` overrides do NOT
sandbox FBNeo on macOS — the user config ini (loaded from the real
`~/Library/Application Support/fbneo/`) carries absolute support paths;
(b) `szAppEEPROMPath` then points every run at the same `vsavj.nv`, and the
bootup counter increments per boot. Runs shorter than the EEPROM write-back
looked deterministic, which disguised the cause. Fix: the harness forces
`szAppEEPROMPath`/hiscore/cheat paths into the per-run sandbox cwd
(`main.cpp`, harness-active branch). Debug method that found it: per-frame
full work-RAM dumps from two runs, diffed → first divergent frame + address
(the standard bug-report format works for emulator bugs too).

## Pre-seeded from the ROM-audit round (2026-07-25, before repo existed)

- **MAME audits the whole board, not just the game:** FBNeo has decryption
  keys compiled in and synthesizes QSound (HLE) without the DSP dump; modern
  MAME requires per-set `.key` files AND the shared device romset
  `qsound_hle.zip` (`dl-1425.bin` — one copy in the rompath serves every
  QSound game, but the audit lists it as missing under *every* dependent
  game, which looks like mass failure). A collection that "works everywhere
  but fails MAME audit" is usually packaging/device ROMs, not bad dumps —
  read the audit line items. Also: `-verifyroms` uses the rompath from
  mame.ini unless `-rompath` is passed — it can "fail" sets it never opened.
- **vhunt2r1 has no key of its own:** its MAME definition loads the parent's
  `vhunt2.key` under that exact filename (identical board key across both
  revisions, CRC 61306b20).
- **Clone/parent split:** `vsavj` and `vhunt2r1` are clones; in split sets
  their gfx/QSound ROMs live in the parent zips (`vsav.zip`, `vhunt2.zip`),
  which must be present alongside.

## MAME `-debug` perturbs multi-CPU timing — never compare its checksums to non-debug runs (paid: 2026-07-25, ~1.5h)

A vsavj replay run under `-debug -debugger none` produces a checksum log that
diverges from the identical non-debug run at frame 12: `RAM:$FF1CF0.l` (a
latch toggling 0x00000000/0xFFFFFFFF) is phase-shifted by one frame, with
±1 knock-on counters later ($FF8080, $FFE420...). It is fully deterministic
*within* debug mode (two -debug runs are bit-identical) and unaffected by how
the initial debugger halt is resumed (`-debugscript go` vs Lua periodic —
identical output). Working theory: the debugger forces finer scheduler
timeslices, shifting 68k↔Z80/QSound interleave; the mechanism doesn't matter,
the rule does:

- **Checksum-exact gates (superset invariant, determinism) run WITHOUT
  `-debug`** — plain `tests/lua/replay.lua` or `replay_guard.lua` cheap mode
  (`GUARD_DEBUG=0`), which are bit-identical to vanilla expectations.
- `-debug` guard runs (breakpoint crash detection) are for crash/field-level
  verdicts only. If a frozen expectation for a -debug run is ever needed, it
  must be frozen from a -debug run.
- Two misleading dead ends already explored: it is NOT the debugger's
  different initial-RAM fill pattern (real, but game clears RAM first), and
  NOT a lost frame at the initial debugger halt.

Also paid in the same session, worth remembering: in MAME debugger
expressions, bare hex like `d0` parses as the **register** D0 — always write
breakpoint/watchpoint addresses with an explicit `0x` prefix
(`bpset 0xd0`). Symptom: the breakpoint silently never fires (or fires
somewhere bizarre) for addresses that look like register names.

## Cross-emulator replays: same inputs ≠ same content (paid: 2026-07-25, ~2h)

The MAME↔FBNeo frame offset (a few frames at boot) does more than shift
frame indices — near any screen transition it changes WHICH content runs.
Three measured mechanisms, all found while validating `tools/compare_fields.py`:

1. **CPU-chosen opponents differ.** `02_demitri_vs_cpu` picks opponent 0x0E
   on MAME and 0x0A on FBNeo: the coin lands at a different attract-PRNG
   state. Any "vs CPU" replay has emulator-divergent content — dual-emulator
   comparisons must use replays where BOTH characters are scripted picks.
2. **Menu presses near an input-accept boundary.** In `03_two_player_vs`,
   S2 pressed 30 frames after S1 (frames 830-833) joins P2 on MAME but NOT
   on FBNeo (boundary measured between 830 and 836) — FBNeo then runs a
   1P-vs-CPU game and every downstream state differs. P2's input path itself
   is fine (verified with a P2-only replay: bit-identical behavior).
3. **Match-start predicate flickers.** The naive anchor predicate
   (match-active flags + full HP) is transiently true during round intros;
   `compare_fields.py` debounces 30 frames before accepting an anchor.

Even with matched content and a 1-frame anchor skew, anim-cursor-derived
fields (anim ptr, box ids) and mid-intro positions differ by a few frames of
phase slip — the tests/fields_m2a.tsv `phase` column (stable/settled/phase)
encodes what is comparable when.

**Authoring rules for dual-emulator replays** (see `16_xemu_2p.rpl`, the
validated template): both characters scripted; menu presses ≥100 frames
after the enabling transition and ≥10 frames from any expected boundary;
cursor moves short (3 frames, no autorepeat ambiguity) on long-stable
screens; input-neutral after the picks. Within-emulator oracles are
unaffected (whole-RAM frame-exact remains the standard there).

## PC-relative reads are DECRYPTED reads on CPS-2 (paid: 2026-07-25, ~45min)

The 68000 issues PC-relative operand reads with FC = program space, so the
CPS-2 B-board decrypts them like opcode fetches. Consequence: tables read
via `(d8,PC,Dn)` / `(d16,PC)` (e.g. the secondary-object type dispatch at
vsavj `PRG:0x054470`, table `0x054484`) are stored ENCRYPTED — their bytes
only make sense in the opcodes view, while normally-addressed data must be
stored raw. Symptom: a "table" that looks like garbage in the data view but
decodes perfectly in `*_opcodes.bin` (or vice versa).

Port rules that follow:
- Whole code regions ported as `code` ops keep working even when they embed
  PC-read tables — the embedded tables re-encrypt with the code.
- A hook that changes an access from PC-relative to An-relative (like the
  proj_hook thunk) changes the fetch space: the new table must be emitted
  RAW, and its source entries must be COPIED FROM THE DECRYPTED view.
- When reading engine tables for analysis, pick the view by how the ENGINE
  addresses them, not by where they live.

## Bare-long "pointers" in code are usually operand pairs — sibling-veto them (paid: 2026-07-25 session 7, ~3h incl. diagnosis)

The bare-long relocation heuristic (any ROM-plausible 32-bit value inside a
ported code region whose target lands in another ported region) is wrong far
more often than right in 68k CODE: adjacent instruction operands fuse into
plausible pointers. Measured in the x088512 companion zone: **47 of ~55
bare-long candidates were false** — e.g. `clr.b $6(a6); moveq #0,d0`
(bytes `0006 7000`) read as "pointer 0x00067000" into a ported region and
rewritten, silently destroying the `moveq`. The resulting crash (vec3 at
engine 0x015096, frame 3025 — the whole "anim state-index delta" frontier
of session 6) surfaced thousands of frames later, in ENGINE code, with a
plausible-looking wrong value: nothing pointed back at the corrupted
instruction. Diagnosis instrument: conditional logging breakpoint
(`GUARD_PROBE`/`GUARD_PROBE_COND` on `run_replay_guarded.sh`) at the engine
consumer, filtering on the relocated table base.

Rules now enforced in `tools/extract_char.py` (source-only regions):
- Immediate loads (`movea.l #imm,An` / `move.l #imm,Dn`) are LABELED refs
  (scan_code_refs), accepted only when the target is inside a ported region
  (immediates may be constants — never fabricate engine refs from them).
- Every remaining bare-long candidate is checked against the SIBLING build
  (vhunt2): its context (exact bytes around a wildcarded long; labeled
  operands wildcarded — they drift between siblings) is located in the
  sibling; a REAL pointer differs there by the host region's sibling shift,
  operand bytes are identical. Identical → veto. Conflicting or absent
  evidence → REJECT (loud in the extract log), never silently rewrite.
- Identical-evidence dominance: a generic context anchor can match several
  sibling sites; one spurious shift-consistent hit must not outvote the
  true twin.

## Engine hooks on hot paths break whole-RAM legacy comparison — by construction (paid: 2026-07-25 session 7, ~2h)

Any hook on a path vanilla executes (the secondary-object dispatch runs for
every object every frame) adds CPU cycles. Two measured consequences on
otherwise-vanilla content, both invisible to gameplay:
1. **Dead-stack ghosts:** interrupts land at skewed instruction boundaries;
   the handler's exception frame + register saves write the same stack
   addresses with different VALUES (e.g. a mid-frame work pointer that has
   advanced further). After return these bytes sit below resting SP
   ($FF8000 at frame-done) — dead, but inside the whole-RAM checksum.
   Observed window: `RAM:$FF7F00-$FF7FFF`.
2. **Sound-handshake phase:** the 68k↔QSound latch byte `RAM:$FF043C`
   (values 04/08) can phase-shift by one frame — the same mechanism as the
   `-debug` timeslice GOTCHA's $FF1CF0 latch.
With BOTH masked (`MASK_RANGES="043c-043d,7f00-8000"` on replay.lua), the
patched stage-4 build is bit-identical to vanilla for the full 02 replay.
Note the dispatch pump also runs for MENU-time objects (cursor sparkles,
UI effects): ghost divergence starts at frame ~470 even in the pick
replay, long before any match — unmasked divergence constants measured on
hook-free stage builds (2886, 1080, 4278) are void on hooked builds;
their masked (live-state) equivalents still hold.
A jsr-thunk hook additionally pushes a DIFFERENT return address than the
vanilla site — the ghost-clean topology (patch only the movea/moveq to
`jmp thunk`, keep the vanilla `jsr (A0)` at its original address, thunk
jumps back to it) eliminates that source; the interrupt-skew ghosts remain.
Zero-cycle table extension was investigated and is IMPOSSIBLE here: the
brief-format dispatch reaches only its inline table, and the code following
both tables is hot engine code with short branches — not relocatable
cycle-exactly. Consequence: the legacy gate's comparison basis for hooked
builds is a maintainer decision (STATE.md, decisions pending).

## PC-relative word tables are DATA — never let a pointer heuristic rewrite them (paid: 2026-07-25, ~1h)

68k brief-format dispatch (`jsr/jmp (d8,PC,Dn.w)`) reads a table of 16-bit
self-relative displacements sitting *inline in the code stream*. Two
adjacent entries like `0006 0068` decode, to any 32-bit scanner, as a
plausible ROM pointer `0x00060068` — and a relocation pass will happily
"fix" them, silently corrupting the table (symptom: a jsr through the
table lands in the weeds one or two states into the ported behavior, far
from the actual damage).

Rules now enforced in `tools/extract_char.py`:
- Every discovered word table's FULL extent is recorded (`table_bytes`)
  and excluded from the bare-long relocation heuristic.
- Table length is bounded by the smallest forward displacement (the case
  code follows the table), so code words are never misread as entries.
- Escaping entries are rewritten as displacements against actual
  placement (`pcrel_tblent`), with a shared per-region ILLEGAL tripwire
  for unported targets — within d16 reach, gap-fitted near the region.
- Regions whose tables reference each other must keep source-relative
  spacing: `[[layout_group]]` / `near_map` in build/manifest/donovan.toml.
