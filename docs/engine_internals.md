# engine_internals — how the engine works, by subsystem

The synthesis document (CLAUDE.md taxonomy): what a stranger reads to
understand the game. Started session 14 with the gfx subsystem; other
subsystems (object system, anim, sound farm, dispatch banks) are still
scattered across docs/atlas/character_tables.md, docs/tables/
reconciliation.md and patch_notes — fold them in as they get touched.

## GFX ROM (sprite/tile) subsystem

- 8 gfx simms per game (x.13m-x.20m, 4MB each) = 32MB = 0x40000
  16x16 4bpp tiles. Group A (13,15,17,19) = tiles 0x00000-0x1FFFF,
  group B (14,16,18,20) = 0x20000-0x3FFFF. 13m/15m hold each tile's
  LEFT 8x16 half (planes 0-1 / 2-3), 17m/19m the right half. Within a
  simm, tile bytes are 16 pairs at stride 4 (canonical extraction:
  tools/gfx_tiles.py; trap: docs/GOTCHAS.md).
- vsavj is a program-only clone set: its gfx (and QSound) members come
  from the parent vsav.zip in the rompath. Any M2b tile work targets
  vsav-member content (or a renamed copy in the build rompath) — NOT
  vsavj.zip, which has no gfx to patch.
- **Measured layout relationships (2026-07-28, locked by
  tests/test_gfx_tiles.sh):**
  - vsav2 vs vhunt2: 202,941 tiles identical at the SAME index — the
    sibling pair shares one gfx layout.
  - vsav2 vs vsav: 201,117 of ~257K non-blank vsav2 tiles exist in vsav
    content-addressed, but only 6,495 at the same index. The shared-cast
    art is the SAME ART, REPACKED at different tile indices. ~56K tiles
    (~7MB) of vsav2 content are absent from vsav: the three newcomers +
    VS2-specific stages/UI (attribution to characters pending the OBJ
    tile-code inventory).
  - One 84KB window (group-A simm offsets 0x200000-0x215000, tiles
    ~0x10000-0x10A80) is byte-identical at the same offsets across
    vsav/vsav2 — system/font tiles that survived the repack in place.
- Consequence for M2b: porting Donovan's tiles is NOT an index-preserving
  copy; his 16-bit OBJ tile codes (+ whatever banking selects among the
  0x40000 tiles) must be remapped from the vsav2 layout to wherever his
  tiles land in the vsav-member space. The shared-tile relocation map
  (content-addressed vsav2-index -> vsav-index) covers effects/shared
  assets he references outside his own art.

## OBJ (sprite) pipeline — the R2 answer (session 14, static decode)

Emitter chain (vsavj): per-frame builder `PRG:0x01ABC8` (clears head of
$708000 list, budget d7=0x380 entries, ~20 subsystem emitters, 0x8000
terminator) -> player dispatcher `0x01AC68` ($FF8400/$FF8800 + linked
companions via +0x28..+0x2E, layer-ordered) -> single-object emitter
`0x01AF9E`: A0 = [[obj+0x1C]+4] = OBJ record; record[0] selects a format
handler (jump table 0x1AFBA; format 2 -> 0x1B234).

Record: format.w, budget.w, count.w (entries=count+1), cptr.l -> X/Y
word-pair list, then (tile.w, attr.w) per entry. Emit: X|=obj+0x1A,
Y|=obj+0x18, tile written RAW — **tile codes are ABSOLUTE 16-bit values;
no per-character base is added**. The 18-bit tile space is reached via
**Y-word bits 13-14 = tile bits 16-17** (FBNeo cps_obj.cpp:
`n |= (ps[1] & 0x6000) << 3`), i.e. the bank rides object field +0x18.
Per-char bank init: `move.w table(pc,d0.w), $18(a6)` — vsavj table
`PRG:0x282D4`, vsav2 `PRG:0x27530` (PC-relative => read via OPCODE
space, the encrypted-read gotcha). Multi-tile entries: bx=(attr>>8&15)+1,
by=(attr>>12&15)+1, cell tile = (n & ~0xF) + (dy<<4) + ((n+dx) & 0xF) —
row stride 16, within-row wrap: **code remaps must be 16-aligned**.

Measured inventories (tools/obj_records.py, locked in
tests/test_gfx_tiles.sh):
- Donovan (vs2, bank 3 = table row 0x13 value 0x6000 + hardcoded #$6000
  setters in his own regions, e.g. vs2 0x5CF38): main band
  0x863F-0xC2EF, 15,171 tiles (1.9MB), extent 0x3CB1; +112 scattered
  low-code shared-effect tiles.
- Jedah (vsavj, bank 2 = slot-0x0F table value 0x4000): main band
  0xAD3D-0xEEBB, 16,658 tiles (2.1MB), extent 0x417F; secondary band
  0xA0A0-0xA51D (1,036 tiles).

**M2b consequence: DONOVAN FITS IN JEDAH'S MAIN BAND** (extent 0x3CB1 <=
0x417F, 15,171 <= 16,658) — no gfx ROM expansion needed for him. Port
shape: (1) re-encode Donovan's tile data into vsav gfx members at
Jedah's band positions (bank 2, 16-aligned constant delta); (2) add the
same delta to every main-band tile word in his ported anim records;
(3) patch his hardcoded #$6000 bank setters to #$4000 (slot-0x0F table
row already provides 0x4000 for free); (4) map the 112 shared-effect
tiles via the content-addressed vsav2->vsav relocation map (their art is
shared, positions differ). Open items: verify no OTHER vsavj consumer
references Jedah's band (exclusivity walk over all slots + stages);
portrait/name tiles (select screen) are a separate inventory; Anita's
bank attribution rides the same +0x18 machinery (her spawn sets it).
