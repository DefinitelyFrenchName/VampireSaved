# patch_notes — per-change detail: every byte, and why

Newest first. Byte-level op lists are generated (never hand-edited): the
authoritative ops for any build come from `tools/gen_donovan_patch.py`
(`build/donovan/patch/patch_notes_fragment.md` reproduces them); this file
records what each patch stage changes and why, at merge time.

## donovan-m2 stage 1 — null relocation (2026-07-25, session 4)

Proves the relocation machinery with ZERO Donovan bytes (any failure is
tooling, not R1). Gate: `tests/test_m2a_stage1_nullreloc.sh` (PASS).

- `PRG:0x0BF6A0 +0x2722` — byte-exact copy of Jedah's player-path hitbox
  block (vanilla `PRG:0x0B0C2E-0x0B3350`, 10018 B — matches the M1-measured
  Jedah footprint exactly), written as raw data INSIDE the encrypted zone
  (proves data-reads-bypass-encryption at the real relocation site).
- `poke32` hitbox_base[0x0F]=`0x0BF7A0`, hitbox_comp[0x0F]=`0x0BF6A0`
  (+ variant rows 0x1F, vanilla-alias asserted) — the +0x60/+0x64 pair
  repointed to the copy.
- `PRG:0x0C1DD0 +6` — `jmp 0x052FCE` trampoline, re-encrypted in hole A,
  behind dispatch_00[0x0F/0x1F]; `PRG:0x3EC720 +6` — `jmp 0x050602`
  trampoline, stored raw above the encrypted range, behind
  dispatch_01[0x0F/0x1F]. Both proven executed (guarded run, no
  exceptions; behavior frame-exact).
- Measured & pinned: slot-0x0F pointer state first lands in RAM at frame
  **2886** of the pick replay (11_pick_donovan .diverge constant); attract
  Jedah demo divergence stays exactly **4278**.
- Provenance: copy = VSAV (byte-identical relocation), trampolines = GEN.
  Build fingerprint `e5e3dc6a76a00cabd38fb3884ff5b160629fc118` (stage
  builds are ephemeral scaffolding — not registered in registry.tsv; only
  the stage-5 freeze registers).
