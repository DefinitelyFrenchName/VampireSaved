# DECISIONS HISTORY — resolved and superseded decisions, verbatim

**Split out of STATE.md 14z-109 (maintainer-directed, 2026-08-26).** STATE.md's
standing decision sections had accumulated every ruling since July under
"Decisions pending", struck through in place — the actually-open items were
drowning in the resolved ones. This file holds the RESOLVED and NO-LONGER-
SHAPING entries, moved **byte-verbatim** (strikethroughs, analysis blocks and
all); STATE.md keeps only genuinely pending decisions and recent rulings that
still shape current work.

**How to use it:** decisions resolve by TOPIC — grep this file for the subject
("packaging", "anim block", "composite", ...). Every entry carries its original
dating and ruling inline. Entries are NEVER rewritten here; a decision that is
later reversed gets its reversal recorded in STATE.md and a marker added
ABOVE the old entry, pointing forward.

**The lifecycle rule (from this cleanup on):** a decision is born in STATE.md
"Decisions pending" -> the ruling is marked DECIDED **in place** (unchanged
practice, `decided-items-leave-pending`) -> at a later cleanup or session
close, once it stops shaping active work, the whole entry moves HERE verbatim.
The CLAUDE.md §5 retraction grep covers this file.

## Rulings from the pre-pending "Decision(s) made" sections (2026-07-31 .. 2026-08-06)



## Decisions made (maintainer, 2026-08-05): two ratifications

**1. CLAUDE.md §4 comparison class v3 — "bounded re-convergent window".**
Ratified for the select screen, which the roster deliberately alters. A
replay qualifies only when all four hold, frozen per replay: a single
CONTIGUOUS run, a fixed ONSET frame, full RE-CONVERGENCE, and match state
UNTOUCHED. Measured over five replays before the ruling (onset 890 in every
one, one run each, 2469-10498 identical frames afterwards including a full
timeout match). It is STRICTER than the frozen first-divergence constant it
sits beside, which never re-converges at all — a narrower licence for one
screen, not a loosening. §4 amended; checker `tools/compare_window.py`,
ground-truthed both directions by `tests/test_compare_window.sh` including
that a bit-identical pair is NOT a silent pass (the expectation asserts the
divergence exists).

**2. The `[[tenant]]` schema.** Ratified, and already implemented for a
single tenant (14z-60t/u) byte-identically on both tracks with the tenant
still at `0x0F`. `docs/project/tenant_manifest.md` moves PROPOSAL -> RATIFIED; its
wheel/ladder/folds sub-tables stay proposal-only because that work is not
done.

Maintainer: "I validate the two items, I don't need testing to see that they
hold on principle." The measurements above were taken before the ruling
regardless — the class's four clauses are what was measured, not what was
hoped for.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-05): new cells SNAP to vsav's lattice

"It feels safer to conform to arcade vsav and snap to it. As long as the UX
is good enough, I don't even mind if the look is not great." So the three
appended cells take positions derived from vsav's own hexagon rather than
PS1's pixel coordinates.

Derived layout (`build/manifest/wheel_layout_proposed.json`): vsav's wheel
is a clean hexagon, rows 1-2-3-4-3-2-1 at y=64..144 every 16, then a single
centre-line cell at y=152 (+8). Mirroring that bottom signature downward:

| cell | id | position |
|---|---|---|
| random (unchanged) | `0x0B` | (248, 152) |
| Huitzil/Phobos | `0x10` | (224, 168) |
| Donovan | `0x13` | (272, 168) |
| Pyron | `0x11` | (248, 176) |

This is geometrically IDENTICAL to the PS1 port's shape (pair, then single
on the centre line); only the id assignment differs, per the maintainer's
amendment — random keeps its vsav cell and Pyron goes to the very bottom.
28 bytes of TABLE B change. Adjacency is still a geometric DRAFT pending
the cursor-movement video.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-05): 0x360+id anim block = INHERIT

Option A: the newcomers inherit their base character's animation from the
shared 16-wide block `0x360-0x36F` (a tenant at `0x13` plays `0x363`),
exactly as vsav2 ships — Capcom left both those folds in place. Sites
`PRG:0x003E40` / `PRG:0x004082` therefore stay folded, recorded as
`inherit` in `docs/project/tenant_manifest.md`. **Fallback, if a playtest shows the
inherited animation is wrong for a newcomer: option B**, relocate the block
to a free 32-wide anim-number range and widen both masks.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-04): M5 voice samples = A then B

"A then B, gates stay strict, option C is rejected." Ship the unfaithful
voice lines silent now; revisit growing the QSound region at M3 within the
measured 16 MB `device_rom_interface<24>` ceiling; never overwrite vsav
content for sample room. Recorded in full under "Decisions pending" above,
where the option analysis lives.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-07-31): electrocute arc colors

Keep vsavj-native shock styling for all victims including Donovan
(option A of the 14z-20 write-up): the arcs/glow are engine-global and
victim-independent; vs2's yellow was a game-wide re-theme, not per-char
data. "Less work, less risk, and we can always come back to it after
all the more important work." LOCKED in tests/test_don_accent.sh
section 3 (shock-window vanilla lock, frozen from a vanilla run) —
revisiting requires changing that gate deliberately.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-02, round 65): M2b+ASSETS freeze

Freeze `b91647c7` as `donovan-m2c` before starting M5 sounds —
"mechanically sound as far as we can tell" (rounds 52-64 playtest
arc + full battery + suite). Frozen basis: three masked windows.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-02, round 64): third mask window

`RAM:$FF4182-$FF41A1` (palette-fade staging slot for select block-A
row 14) RATIFIED into the masked legacy basis — option A of the
14z-49b write-up, after the recolor-necessity A/B (14z-49d) showed
options B and C strictly worse. Condition attached and honored:
detailed documentation + a standing confirmation path
(`tests/audit_mask_window_ff4182.sh`; spec in docs/game/atlas/ram.md).
Extension policy stands: future palette-block ports extend the
window per measured slot, never pre-widen.

## Decision made (maintainer, 2026-08-06): select art = option A

Option A of the 14z-62e write-up: the per-hover bank thunk for the
portrait-record object + the tenant's select art in WIDE group C at
native codes; `vsav.zip` leaves the rompath entirely pristine [**14z-105:
not quite — the later effect-tail pass writes four GROUP-A members
(vm3.13m/15m/17m/19m); measured by the release packager**]. Blank-pool
relocation (option B) remains the fallback if the measured hook cost
violates the standing flicker watch. Maintainer also flagged suspected
graphical corruption in the session captures — playtest of `39597268`
in progress; the expected-interim inventory is in
docs/project/playtest_m3a_interims.md so the report can classify against it.
Original write-up kept below.

## Entries moved from "Decisions pending" (each was ruled/superseded in place before moving)

- **~~THE FIELD TEST~~ SCHEDULED (maintainer, 2026-08-25): "tonight unless
  I struggle building".** Bundle assembled and verified OUTSIDE the repo at
  `../mister_fieldtest_14z108/` — the WIDE MRA, `vsavjw.zip`, the PATCHED
  `vsav.zip`, `qsound.zip`, and a README. **All 31 CRC-identified parts the
  MRA declares were verified to resolve from those three zips**, because an
  unresolved part is filled with `0xFF` rather than refused. The `.rbf` is
  NOT in the bundle — it comes from the Windows box and its sha256 must be
  checked first, since a timing-FAILING seed emits a bitstream
  indistinguishable from a good one.

- ~~**MiSTer SOURCE SEPARATION — how far does "unmixed" reach? (14z-107 (8))**~~
  **DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): the CORE stays unmixed; SHARED
  `tools/` and `tests/` STAY AS THEY ARE** — *"shared /tools and /tests are
  a bit messy but acceptable, especially since it's not 100% risk-free."*
  The standing rule the maintainer set: the MiSTer core must not be MIXED
  with the other sources — same repo is fine, same subfolder is not.
  **Already satisfied, and asserted rather than claimed:** our RTL lives in
  `cores/cps2w/hdl` while `cores/cps1`, `cores/cps2` and `cores/cps15` are
  BYTE-UNTOUCHED (`tests/test_jtcores_twin.sh` check 2e is a `git diff`
  assertion, added in D1 — the slice that first added RTL); in this tree
  `emu/fbneo`, `emu/mame` and `emu/jtcores` are separate submodules with
  their patch mirrors in parallel `emu/*-patches/` dirs.
  **NOT to be "tidied" later:** the MiSTer tools (`run_sim_jtcps2.sh`,
  `setup_jtcores.sh`, `mister_mra.sh`, `gen_vsavjw_xml.py`,
  `rpl2siminputs.py`, `check_wram_dumps.py`) and gates (`test_mister_*`,
  `test_jtcores_twin`, `audit_sdram_bank_load`, `test_sim_wram_contract`)
  STAY in the shared `tools/` and `tests/`. A move would touch
  `tests/ci_portable.txt`, `tests/ci_static.txt`, `run_all_static.sh`'s
  orphan check and every doc path naming them — i.e. it risks the
  "checks that stopped checking" class (14z-95, four instances) for zero
  functional gain. Ruled acceptable-as-is; do not re-open it as housekeeping.

- **MiSTer PACKAGING — two questions slice D0 surfaced (14z-107 (5), NEW).**
  Neither blocks D1-D4; both must be answered before a release.
  1. **Which MRA is the core's MAIN one?** `jtframe mra cps2w` puts the Euro
     `vsav` parent at `release/mra/` and everything else — including the
     WIDE set — under `_alternatives/`. For a core whose whole purpose is
     the WIDE set that is backwards. *Recommendation: make the WIDE MRA the
     main one and keep the stock `vsavj` reference leg in `_alternatives/`;*
     it is a `[parse] main_setnames` change in the fork's toml, and it moves
     nothing in the images.
  2. **How does a release carry BOTH `vsav.zip` flavours?** The WIDE romset
     is a CLONE set whose parent is the BUILD's `vsav.zip` (the merged build
     patches `vm3.13m/15m/17m/19m`), while the stock reference-leg MRA needs
     the PRISTINE dump — and both MRAs name the parent zip `vsav.zip`. On
     FBNeo/MAME `run_wide.sh` resolves this by OVERLAYING a rompath, a
     runtime notion MiSTer's MRA does not have. *Options: (a) ship only the
     WIDE MRA and drop the reference leg from the MiSTer package (it lives
     on in the sim gate either way); (b) rename the WIDE parent to a
     distinct set (`vsavw.zip`) via `[parse] parents`, which costs a
     zip-name divergence from the FBNeo/MAME package; (c) make the WIDE
     romset self-contained by carrying its own copies of the eight GFX and
     two QSound parent members — +40 MB of zip, and it stops being a clone
     set. Recommendation: (b), which keeps one romset directory able to feed
     all three emulators. NOT decided; it is a distribution-shape call.*

- ~~**THE BANK-0 SLOT COUNT — a fork-surface call (14z-107 (4), NEW).**~~
  **DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): option (A), add `jtframe_ram1_7slots.v`
  to the fork.** SDRAM bank 1 stays at exactly the two streams
  (PCM + group-C obj bank 4) that `tests/audit_sdram_bank_load.sh` modelled
  when it returned GO, so the measurement keeps covering the shipped design.
  **AND THE RELATED QUESTION IS RULED TOO — the profile is selected at
  RUNTIME from a spare MRA header bit, NOT by `ifdef`** (maintainer,
  2026-08-23). Consequence, and the reason it matters: stock `vsavj` on our
  own RBF then runs with the wide decode CLEAR, so Rule 1 v2's "profile-gated
  ... so stock `vsavj` is untouched BY CONSTRUCTION" holds on FPGA as a FACT
  rather than as an inertness argument, and the reference-leg MRA becomes a
  real stock leg. It also mirrors the FBNeo shape (a flag set from the driver
  entry). Every gated site takes a `wide_en` wire off that header bit — D1's
  QSound latch is the first.
  **IMPLEMENTED 14z-107 (6): the bit is MRA header byte 41, bit 0, ACTIVE
  LOW** (`0xFF` — the generator's own `[header] fill` — means profile OFF;
  the WIDE MRA writes `0xFE`). The polarity is forced, not chosen: any other
  would change every stock MRA this core emits. RTL
  `cores/cps2w/hdl/jtcps2w_profile.v`; measured end to end in
  `tests/test_mister_mra_map.sh` and exhaustively simulated with three
  must-fire controls in `tests/test_mister_wide_gate.sh`. **Option (A),
  `jtframe_ram1_7slots.v`, is NOT yet written — it is D2's need, not D1's,
  and D1 confirmed it: D1 changes no placement and adds no slot.**
  Original entry:
  **THE BANK-0 SLOT COUNT — a fork-surface call (14z-107 (4), NEW).** The
  placement map (`docs/project/mister_map.md` §5) puts seven consumers in
  SDRAM bank 0 (RAM/VRAM/ORAM, VRAM-DMA, gfx-ORAM, main ROM, Z80, the QSound
  high window, group-C obj bank 5) and upstream's family stops at
  `jtframe_ram1_5slots` (`ram2_4..6slots` are the only 6-slot variants and
  they carry two write ports).
  - **(A) add `jtframe_ram1_7slots.v` to the fork** — a mechanical member of
    an existing formulaic family. Keeps SDRAM bank 1 to exactly the two
    streams (PCM + obj) that `tests/audit_sdram_bank_load.sh` modelled when
    it returned GO.
  - **(B) move the Z80 program to bank 1** — bank 0 drops to six slots
    (`jtframe_ram2_6slots`, second write port tied off) and bank 1 becomes
    `jtframe_rom_3slots`. Zero new jtframe files, but bank 1 then carries
    THREE streams, which is beyond what was measured, and bank 1 lands at
    15.95 of 16 MB.
  - **Recommendation: (A).** The GO verdict is a statement about a two-stream
    bank 1; option (B) spends that evidence to save one boilerplate file.
  Related and unresolved either way: **should the profile be selected at
  RUNTIME from a spare header byte** (`jtcps1_prom_we.v:52-54` — "6 are
  actually used and 10 are reserved") rather than by `ifdef` in `cps2w`? A
  compile-time gate means stock `vsavj` on our RBF gets the widened PRG
  decode and the 3-bit obj bank; both are provably inert for stock content
  (`cps2_wide.md` A1/A2), but a header bit would restore
  gating-by-construction and make the MRA the profile selector.

- ~~**THE MiSTer MEMORY-MAP ROUTE (14z-107 (2)) — NEW, and it is the arc's
  next fork in the road.**~~ **DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): option (2),
  the BANK REPACK, measuring first; XL is the FALLBACK** — the ruling was
  *"attempt repack (measuring first)"*, with `JTFRAME_SDRAM_XL` (two chips,
  128 MB) kept in reserve if the repack fails. Vanilla's 32 MB of GFX stays
  exactly where it is in banks 2+3 and the ~6.4 MB of tenant art goes into
  bank 1 alongside the QSound PCM, reached by the profile-gated promoted
  tile-code bit. **The measurement the ruling required was taken the same
  day and says GO** — bank 1's PCM is already at a 98.8% row-miss rate so it
  has no locality to lose, and the worst case runs at 26.3% of a single
  bank against the 32.9% bank 0 already sustains
  (`tests/audit_sdram_bank_load.sh`, `build/sdram_bank_load_14z107.log`,
  verdict in STATE 14z-107 (3)). It bounds the headroom; it does not prove
  the repacked design. Original text kept below.

  **THE MiSTer MEMORY-MAP ROUTE (14z-107 (2)) — the arc's next fork in the
  road.** The profile ruling (WIDE v1 verbatim, one romset)
  is NOT in question here; only HOW the bytes reach the FPGA. The facts that
  opened it (all measured 14z-107, `docs/platform/mister.md`): at our pin
  `v1.7.3` **64 MB is PHYSICAL**, not a default — jtframe's own table stops
  at `AW 23 = 64 MB`, the bank geometry `COW = AW==22 ? 9 : 10` has no AW=24
  arm (an AW=24 build never drives `addr[9]`, aliasing every address with
  `addr ^ 0x200`), and `sys.tcl` assigns exactly 13 A pins, 2 BA and one nCS.
  The `JTFRAME_SDRAM_XL` 128 MB tier IS real, but UPSTREAM only (added
  2026-06-19, `5981db26`), implemented as **two chips on one module selected
  by the top address bit with chip select on nCS POLARITY**, and reachable
  only inside the `JTFRAME_SDRAM_CACHE` branch. Meanwhile the fit numbers
  (`docs/project/mister_fit.md` §6) say the roster's **total is ~56.1 MB
  against a 64 MB tier** — PRG 6 MB fits bank 0 today, QSound 16 MB fits
  bank 1 today, and only GFX overflows, by ~6.4 MB. The question is
  placement, not capacity.

  **(1) UPREV to upstream master + `JTFRAME_SDRAM_XL` + convert CPS-2 to
  `cfg/mem.yaml` cache lanes.** The architecturally "correct" long-term path:
  the tier is real, CPS-3 already ships on it at ~80 MB, and it leaves room
  for anything later. Cost: a **3057-commit** jump to an **UNTAGGED moving
  target** (v1.7.3, 2024-01-18, is the newest version tag and predates XL by
  ~2.4 years); re-basing our two fork commits; rewriting the whole simulation
  recipe (`test.cpp` -> `verilator/test.cpp` split, `bin/jtsim` rewritten,
  `game.yaml` -> `files.yaml`, `-inputs` now a `.cab` script so
  `sim_inputs.hex` and `tools/rpl2siminputs.py` are orphaned, input bit 1
  coin2 -> service); converting CPS-2 to `mem.yaml`; and **widening the
  shared CPS-1/2 `jtcps1_sdram.v` `[22:0]` code that upstream never widened**
  (its `// change this when moving to 8MB+ GFX` comment is still there on
  master). Requires the 128 MB module.

  **(2) STAY at the `v1.7.3` pin and fit inside 64 MB by BANK REPACK.**
  Vanilla's 32 MB of GFX stays exactly where it is in banks 2+3, so the
  superset invariant is untouched by construction, and the ~6.4 MB of tenant
  art goes into **bank 1, above the PCM** — which after a 16 MB-capable
  QSound carrying 8.9 MB of real content has **~7.1 MB spare** — reached by
  the promoted tile-code bit,
  [**CORRECTED 14z-107 (4): "~6.4 MB into bank 1" is wrong — that is the
  LIVE-BYTE count. The ADDRESS FOOTPRINT is 15.45 MB and needs BOTH banks'
  spare; see `docs/project/mister_map.md` §1.**] i.e. the RTL expression of the profile-gated
  19-bit promote WIDE v1 already makes on FBNeo. No framework uprev, no
  second chip, no `mem.yaml` conversion, and it would run on a 64 MB module
  as well as on the maintainer's 128 MB one. **Risk, named honestly:** object
  reads would share bank 1 with PCM streaming, on the throughput path jtframe
  hand-tunes per target (`jtcps1_sdram.v:167-175`, `OBJ_LATCH` 0 on MiSTer
  "to increase object throughput"), and it is **UNMEASURED**. Measuring it
  also needs the Verilator SDRAM model fixed first (it decodes 8 MB per bank,
  so bank 1 above 8 MB currently aliases in simulation — ~3 constants).
  **BOTH DONE 14z-107 (3): the model is fixed (fork commit 3 — and it was NOT
  ~3 constants; the dropped bit is `addr[22]` on `sdram_a[9]`, not
  `addr[9]`), and the traffic IS now measured** —
  `tests/audit_sdram_bank_load.sh`, `build/sdram_bank_load_14z107.log`.

  **RECOMMENDATION: (2)**, with (1) as the long-term path if upstream ever
  tags again. Rationale: (2) keeps a pinned, reproducible framework and a
  working simulation gate, needs no dual-chip inference, and widens the
  hardware audience rather than narrowing it; (1) trades all of that for
  headroom we do not need at 56.1 MB. **Both options still require the
  core-side FORMAT work either way** — the GFX tile-code promote, the 68k
  `rom_cs` window (including the `0x400000` objcfg collision), and the
  QSound latch/width fix. Gameplay-visible consequence: none under either
  option; the only player-facing difference is that (2) may drop the 128 MB
  hardware requirement to 64 MB.

- ~~**THE SIM HARNESS'S P2 / 6-BUTTON EXTENSION (14z-107, NOT blocking).**~~
  **DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): option A, LATER** — *"agreed, we can
  do it later"*.
  **SPLIT AND HALF-CLOSED 14z-107 (8). The FIDELITY half is DONE; the
  COVERAGE half remains deferred by the ruling above.**
  * **FIDELITY — SHIPPED, fork commit `519aff8b` (LOCAL ONLY).** It was a
    BUG, not a gap: `SimInputs` held P1's AND P2's buttons 5 and 6 DOWN
    (`&0xf0` and a `0xff` seed on a `[9:0]` ACTIVE-LOW port), so the two
    legs of `test_mister_sim_anchor` were not running identical inputs.
    Measured before the fix against MAME (`RAM:$FF8058/5A/5C/5E`) and fixed
    with `& ~0xf` / `0x3ff`. The anchor was re-measured and did NOT move
    (2146 / 2609 / 463); every §4 field still agrees and the arcade draw is
    the same pair. Session 14z-107 (8).
  * **COVERAGE — STILL DEFERRED, unchanged by the above.** Making buttons
    5/6 and P2 SCRIPTABLE is still fork work nobody has done;
    `tools/rpl2siminputs.py` still refuses `p2=` and `p1=4/5/6` loudly, so
    `02_demitri_vs_cpu` and `04_select_fuzz` still do not translate, and the
    P2-identity fields are still excluded by name in the anchor gate. The
    motivating case is unchanged: a 2P replay would pin the arcade-draw
    opponent. Nothing here is blocked on it.

  Original 14z-107 (7) framing, kept: **UPGRADED FROM COVERAGE TO FIDELITY,
  and the maintainer may want to re-time it: `SimInputs` does not merely
  LACK buttons 5 and 6, it HOLDS THEM DOWN.** `test.cpp:201` is
  `dut.joystick1 = (dut.joystick1&0xf0) | (v&0xf);` and `&0xf0` discards
  bits 9:8 that the line above had just released; joystick is ACTIVE LOW and
  `jtcps2_main.v:266` wires `joystick1[9:7]` into `in1`. So every simulated
  run this lane has taken had P1 holding buttons 5 and 6 from the first
  input line to the last — and only EOF releases them, so a SHORTER input
  file changes the inputs. The MAME leg does not do this, so the two legs of
  `test_mister_sim_anchor` are not running identical inputs; they still
  agree on every mapped field and pick the same P1 record base, so nothing
  measured is invalidated. The fix is one line (`& ~0xf`) in the SAME commit
  as the P2/6-button work, and it WILL move the frozen anchor again — which
  is why it is a deliberate slice and was not done in 14z-107 (7).
  [DONE 14z-107 (8) — and the anchor did not move; P2's buttons 5/6 were
  held too, by the `0xff` seed `parse_inputs()` never corrects.]
  So the fork's third commit is queued, not open: extend
  `test.cpp`'s `SimInputs` (P2 joystick + buttons 5/6, `dip_test` off
  button 4) when a refused replay is actually needed — the motivating one
  being a 2P replay that pins the arcade-draw opponent and retires the
  P2-identity exclusion in `test_mister_sim_anchor.sh`. Original entry:
  **THE SIM HARNESS'S P2 / 6-BUTTON EXTENSION (14z-107, NOT blocking).**
  jtframe v1.7.3's `SimInputs` is P1-only with 4 buttons (bit 11 doubles as
  `dip_test`), so `02_demitri_vs_cpu` and `04_select_fuzz` still REFUSE
  translation — and 14z-107 gave the question a concrete cost: the only §4
  field disagreement on the MiSTer oracle is the 1P ARCADE DRAW picking a
  different CPU opponent (sound-state-fed, `atlas/ram.md:99`), which a 2P
  replay would pin. Options: **(A) extend `test.cpp`'s `SimInputs` in the
  fork now** (a third commit, same macro-gated shape as the WRAM hook — P2
  joystick + buttons 5/6, and a bit for `dip_test` that is not button 4);
  **(B) leave it and keep excluding the P2-identity fields by name**, as the
  gate does today. **RECOMMENDATION: A, but AFTER the profile-shape ruling
  lands** — it is input coverage, not the oracle, and the oracle is green.
  Gameplay consequence: none (test harness only).

- ~~**THE MiSTer PROFILE SHAPE (14z-106, slice B measured).**~~
  **DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): OPTION A — WIDE v1 VERBATIM on the
  128 MB tier.** *"verbatim indeed: 128MB always was the target."* So there
  is ONE profile and ONE romset across FBNeo / MAME / MiSTer, and the MiSTer
  work is width plumbing only; the 128 MB module is a stated hardware
  requirement in the README.
  **CORRECTION 14z-107 (2), MARKED IN PLACE — THE RULING STANDS, THE
  IMPLEMENTATION ASSUMPTION DOES NOT.** The PROFILE decision above (WIDE v1
  verbatim, one romset, one release artifact) is unchanged and is not
  reopened. Two things attached to it are now measured false:
  (a) ~~"the MiSTer work is width plumbing only"~~ — the CPS-2 core caps GFX
  at 32 MB in the OBJECT FORMAT (16-bit code + 2-bit bank,
  `jtcps2_obj_scan.v:47,152`), the 68k at a flat 4 MB
  (`jtcps2_main.v:184`), scroll at 8 MB with no bank input, and QSound at a
  7-bit latch. **No SDRAM tier lifts any of them**; the GFX one is the same
  19-bit tile promote WIDE v1 already ratified on FBNeo, so it is the
  profile in RTL rather than a new invention — but it is core work, not
  plumbing. (b) ~~the 128 MB tier being a bit-width away~~ — at our pin
  (`v1.7.3`) 64 MB is PHYSICAL (table, row/column geometry, and pin
  assignments all saturate; `docs/platform/mister.md` "The SDRAM ceiling at
  our pin"), and the `JTFRAME_SDRAM_XL` tier exists only upstream, 3057
  commits away, in a branch that also requires `JTFRAME_SDRAM_CACHE`.
  The route is now its own pending decision, **THE MiSTer MEMORY-MAP
  ROUTE**, above. Option B (a tighter MiSTer-only profile) was
  killed by measurement, not preference: 14z-107 read the bank allocation
  (`jtcps1_sdram.v:158-164`, `:332-410`) and GFX ALONE forces the tier —
  bank 0 has ~8 MB spare (so PRG 6 MB fits the CURRENT tier) and bank 1
  holds PCM alone in 16 MB (so QSound 16 MB fits too), while banks 2+3 are
  full at 32 MB. Any GFX above 32 MB needs banks > 16 MB = `SDRAMW` 24 =
  the same 128 MB module, so B buys zero hardware compatibility while
  forking the romset into a second generation. The only route that would
  keep a 64 MB module is a bank-1 repack (GFX sharing the PCM bank, ~6.4 MB
  of its 8 MB spare) — rejected as arbiter surgery on the object-throughput
  path jtframe already hand-tunes per target (`jtcps1_sdram.v:167-175`),
  and it drags a MiSTer-only layout back in anyway. **That repack, not B,
  is the fallback if the 128 MB tier proves unreachable.** ~~OPEN AND BEING
  MEASURED (14z-107, maintainer: *"as to IF we can address... only one way
  to find out!"*): whether `SDRAMW` 24 is parameter plumbing or controller
  surgery in jtframe at v1.7.3, and whether the physical 128 MB module is
  addressable by its SDRAM controller.~~ **ANSWERED 14z-107 (2): NEITHER —
  at `v1.7.3` `SDRAMW=24` is not reachable at all** (no table row, no AW=24
  arm in the bank geometry, `addr[9]` undriven, 13 A pins / 2 BA / 1 nCS
  assigned); the 128 MB tier is upstream-only, is TWO CHIPS on one module
  selected by nCS polarity, and lives only in the cache-lane controller.
  Two knock-ons for the reasoning above: the repack fallback is now a
  first-class option rather than a last resort (**the total FITS 64 MB** —
  ~56.1 MB measured, `mister_fit.md` §6), and the "arbiter surgery"
  objection to it is still the right one to weigh, but so is a 3057-commit
  uprev to an untagged master. Original entry:
  **THE MiSTer PROFILE SHAPE (14z-106, slice B measured).** The numbers
  (`docs/project/mister_fit.md`) remove the roster trade-off: the group-C
  art (6.39 MB) cannot fit vanilla's 32 MB GFX (0.49 MB blank, upper
  bound), so any MiSTer build needs a wider GFX tier than jtcps2's
  documented 64 MB `JTFRAME_SDRAM_LARGE`. Options: **(A) WIDE v1 verbatim
  (PRG 6 / GFX 48 / QSound 16 MB) on a 128 MB SDRAM tier** — one profile
  and one romset across FBNeo/MAME/MiSTer, MiSTer work = width plumbing
  only (jtframe `SDRAMW` 23→24 and +1 bank/prog/ioctl bit, the core's
  `main_rom_addr`/gfx/`qsnd_addr` buses, the 14z-86 QSound latch fix), no
  content change; cost: framework surgery, profile-gated in the fork,
  ONE hardware requirement (the 128 MB module the maintainer has — users
  with 32/64 MB modules cannot run it, which the README must say). **(B)
  a tighter MiSTer-only profile** (e.g. PRG 5 MB / GFX 40 MB / QS 9 MB):
  saves nothing architecturally — every bus still widens by one bit, and
  it forks the romset/manifests/tests into a second generation for no
  gain. **RECOMMENDATION: A.** Gameplay-visible consequence: none; the
  only player-facing fact is the 128 MB requirement.

- ~~**MiSTer ALIGNMENT (14z-106) — five questions before any RTL.**~~
  **ALL FIVE RULED (maintainer, 2026-08-22).** Rulings, then what each
  one commits us to; the original brief follows unchanged.
  1. **Base tree — RULED: a SEPARATE CORE**, so the reference CPS-II
     core stays separately usable; ours respects Jotego's licence(s) and
     is FOSS "if the licensing scheme allows"; the exact fork mechanism
     is left to my proposal. **Facts (jtcores README, checked
     2026-08-22):** jtcores and jtframe are **GPL-3.0** ("you are
     obliged to publish your code if you use mine") — so our core is
     FOSS by obligation, not just preference, and must ship its source.
     **PROPOSAL (my recommendation, open to veto):** (a) a PUBLIC fork of
     `jotego/jtcores` under the maintainer's GitHub, GPL-3.0 retained,
     branched from a pinned upstream tag; (b) a NEW core directory
     (working name `cores/cps2w`, final name TBD) that reuses the cps2
     RTL the way cps1/cps15/cps2 already share it through jtframe
     macros, producing its OWN RBF (`jtcps2w.rbf`) — the stock
     `jtcps2.rbf` is never rebuilt or touched; (c) pinned here as
     submodule `emu/jtcores` on the fork branch, with the fork's diff
     mirrored as `emu/jtcores-patches/0001-*.patch` for review — the
     MAME/FBNeo pattern, and what keeps Rule 1 v2's "small,
     human-reviewable set of declarative lines" honest on a third
     implementation; (d) upstream PR later, at the maintainer's
     discretion — the separate-core shape is what makes one possible.
     FIRST TASK of the arc: read the fork and VERIFY (b)'s sharing
     mechanism — it is my reading of the tree layout, not a measurement.
     **LICENCE GAP SURFACED:** this repository carries NO LICENSE file.
     The core fork is GPL-3.0 by obligation; the licence of THIS tree
     (tools, patches, docs, authored assets) is the maintainer's call and
     is now a pending decision (below).
  2. **Profile shape — RULED: measure first, choose on numbers** (the
     recommendation adopted). Arc task: merged-m6 GFX occupancy per
     group/bank + the real PRG extent, then the fit options.
  3. **Governance/oracle — RULED: the recommendation adopted** — Rule 1
     v2 extends verbatim; jtframe/Verilator SIMULATION is the gate,
     HARDWARE is the field test (the MAME-oracle / playtest split).
  4. **Environment — RULED: MiSTer with a single SDRAM module, plus a
     Jammix extension card**
     **AMENDED (maintainer, 2026-08-23): DUAL SDRAM IS OFF THE TABLE** —
     *"I don't own any nor plan to"*. This forecloses MiSTer's DUAL-SLOT
     path (`SDRAM2_*` / `sys_dual_sdram.tcl`), which was already
     unreachable in jtframe (no `SDRAM2_*` ports on `jtframe_emu`) and
     which conflicts on pins with the analog I/O board the Jammix CRT
     field test needs. **It does NOT foreclose the upstream XL tier:**
     XL is TWO CHIPS INSIDE ONE MODULE in the ONE slot, selected by the
     top address bit with chip-select carried on nCS POLARITY
     (`jtframe_burst_io.v:158`) — i.e. exactly what a standard MiSTer
     128 MB module is (doc/sdram.md catalogue IDs 1/4/8/9 = 2 units).
     Caveat carried: that the module inverts chip 1's /CS is INFERRED
     from the RTL, never measured — so if the XL fallback is ever taken,
     confirm WHICH 128 MB module is in hand first. The chosen primary
     route (the bank repack) needs no such confirmation: it fits a
     64 MB tier and is module-agnostic. (CRT at original resolution/frequencies —
     the field test can be made on real video timing). **OPEN DETAIL:
     which module size?** jtcps2's own docs: CPS2 games with >= 16 MB GFX
     need a 64 MB module; a MiSTer-shaped WIDE (GFX up to 32 MB + PRG +
     QSound 16 MB) needs at least 64 MB and likely 128 MB
     (JTFRAME_SDRAM_LARGE). Confirm before the profile numbers are fixed.
  5. **Distribution — RULED: MRA + RBF over the same release members**,
     covered by the tagged release; stock `vsavj` in the MRA "if
     necessary and/or makes sense — argue for/against". **ARGUMENT:**
     an MRA binds one romset to one RBF, so a stock-`vsavj` MRA aimed at
     OUR RBF is not redundant with the official core's — it is the
     STOCK LEG of the emulator superset invariant on FPGA (the patched
     core running unmodified vsavj must behave as the reference core
     does), i.e. a test instrument that must exist in-tree regardless.
     Shipping it in the release too costs one small XML and buys players
     a same-RBF A/B and a sanity check that their dump is good. Against:
     a second menu entry people may pick by mistake. RECOMMENDATION:
     ship BOTH, the stock one labelled "(stock vsavj — reference leg)".

  ORIGINAL BRIEF: **MiSTer ALIGNMENT (14z-106) — five questions before any RTL.** Built
  only from what the record already measured (`docs/project/cps2_wide.md`
  "Known limits", source-verified 14z-86 at jtcores @1ae053f3 + jtdsp16
  @71fa564a; STATE_HISTORY 14z-85/86). The facts: jtcps15 QSound is LLE
  (jtdsp16 + the real dl-1425), but its sample path is 23-bit with a
  7-bit bank latch, so content in our QSound extension (banks 0x80+)
  would ALIAS onto legacy samples — a ~4-line RTL width fix; the stock
  core caps 68k PRG at 4 MB and GFX at 32 MB (2 x 16 MB) inside a 64 MB
  SDRAM_LARGE map, so WIDE v1 (PRG 6 / GFX 48 / QS 16) does NOT fit and a
  MiSTer-shaped profile is required; a 17-character variant is impossible
  (ruled 2026-08-15 — full roster or nothing).
  1. **Base tree.** Fork jotego/jtcores at which tag/commit, and is the
     intent an upstreamable separate machine (the `vsavjw` pattern — a
     new MRA/core variant leaving stock `vsav` untouched) or a private
     fork? RECOMMENDATION: pin a tag as a submodule under `emu/jtcores`
     exactly as MAME/FBNeo are pinned, carry our change as a patch file
     in `emu/jtcores-patches/`, and shape it as a separate machine so
     the emulator superset invariant has a stock leg to compare against.
  2. **Profile shape (gameplay-visible, yours).** PRG target: 6 MB as
     WIDE v1, or the measured minimum (D+H alone overflow 4 MB by ~310 KB;
     the three-tenant merged image's real extent should be re-measured
     before picking)? GFX must come back from 48 MB to <= 32 MB: which
     tenant tiles get per-slot exclusivity/banking, i.e. what art may
     not coexist on screen? RECOMMENDATION: measure the merged-m6 GFX
     occupancy per group/bank first (the 14z-62/66 census tooling) and
     present the fit options with numbers; do not choose blind.
  3. **Governance and the oracle.** Rule 1 v2 (profile-gated, stock
     `vsavj` bit-identical on the patched core, ratified per profile
     version) should extend verbatim — but MiSTer has no headless
     per-frame work-RAM harness. Is the gate a Verilator/jtframe
     simulation of the core (slow but deterministic and scriptable), a
     hardware capture protocol (the maintainer plays; no RAM checksum),
     or both? RECOMMENDATION: simulation as the gate, hardware as the
     field test — same split as MAME (oracle) vs playtest today.
  4. **Environment.** Does the maintainer have a MiSTer (with the 128 MB
     SDRAM module — JTFRAME_SDRAM_LARGE needs it) and the Quartus
     toolchain, or is simulation the only lane this side? This decides
     who builds the RBF and how fast the confirmation loop is.
  5. **Distribution.** MRA + RBF over the SAME release members as
     `release/merged-m6/` (the patch artifact does not change shape); the
     tagged GitHub release ruled 14z-105 then covers both. Confirm, and
     whether the MRA should also carry the stock-profile `vsavj` entry.

- ~~**ADOPT THE HIT-CLASS MAP EXTENSION + RE-FREEZE huitzil & pyron
  (14z-82b).**~~ **DECIDED 2026-08-12 (maintainer): ADOPTED** — shipped as
  huitzil-m4 (e66678d0) + pyron-m3 (6c7f7322), 14z-82c. Original entry: The generated `hitclass_map_extend` site_thunk fixes a
  playtest-reachable crash LATENT IN BOTH FROZEN TENANT BUILDS (pyron's
  satellite type-64 contact = the f7997 vec3, measured on pyron-m2 solo;
  Huitzil's 68/72 share the pool). Numbers, all measured on a probe build
  (tests/audit_hitclass_map_cost.sh, rerunnable): fix holds through the
  11,017-frame soak that crashes the frozen build; LEGACY BIT-IDENTICAL
  over 30,284 frames on four replays, with a fire census showing legacy
  never enters the map at all [**THAT FIGURE IS RETRACTED — 14z-92 M4
  measured 230 legacy entries corpus-wide; the adoption still stands and
  the argument is "legacy enters and gets vanilla answers"**]. Cost of
  adoption: the row goes in
  huitzil.toml + pyron.toml (shared, dedups on the merge) → BOTH
  verticals re-freeze (new fingerprints; registry rows; their frozen
  masked legacy self-logs re-measured — expected unchanged given the
  zero-fire census, but measured is the standard). Donovan/stock
  untouched. RECOMMENDATION: adopt — it is the third instance of the
  "vs2 widened an index consumer" class (14z-26, 14z-35 precedents) and
  the crash needs one satellite contact to fire in a real match.

- ~~**DONOVAN's map entries 61/62 (14z-82b, separate and smaller).**~~
  **DECIDED 2026-08-12 (maintainer): (a) KEEP VANILLA'S ZEROS** — his
  sword-companion objects' hit-class reactions stay as every shipped
  build has had them; measured unexercised (0 map entries in his
  replays). Revisit only if his satellite hits ever feel wrong in
  playtest — then it is 2 bytes in the generator's policy + a Donovan
  re-freeze. Original entry:
  MEASURED SINCE: his types 59-63 are the projectile-pool objects his
  SWORD-COMPANION machine spawns (61 = the sword-routine region
  x065e5a's family; spawns measured in both his replays), and they enter
  the hit-class map ZERO times in his replays — the missing reaction is
  UNEXERCISED, so (a) costs nothing observable today. Original entry: vs2
  gives his satellite types 61/62 hit classes 0x0E/0x04 where vsavj
  holds the do-nothing 0 — so his type-61/62 projectile hits currently
  produce NO hit-class reaction on every shipped build, and always have.
  The fix above deliberately keeps vanilla's zeros (donovan-m3a
  byte-untouched). Options: (a) keep zeros — shipped behavior, nothing
  moves; (b) adopt vs2's two bytes in the same thunk body — vs2-faithful
  hit reactions for his satellite, at the cost of a Donovan re-freeze
  and a battery re-measure. If (b) is ever wanted, it is a 2-byte change
  to the generator's policy plus the measurements; playtest feel decides
  whether the missing reaction is real. RECOMMENDATION: (a) for now;
  revisit if his satellite hits ever feel wrong in playtest.

- **IF `anim` CANNOT LEAVE THE CRYPT WINDOW — the fallback order is set
  (maintainer, 2026-08-10).** Framing recorded verbatim in effect: *"we'll see
  if and how we can grow the crypt window and still have everything work, or
  if we need to cut down access to a character (in which case I'll leave Pyron
  aside, but that's kind of a last resort)"*.

  So the ladder, best to worst:
  1. **Make `anim` movable** — root-cause the odd pointer. If this works, no
     decision is needed at all, which is why it is the active task.
  2. **Grow the crypt window in the WIDE profile.** A profile change, so
     maintainer-approved by construction, and it must be shown not to break
     anything (the profile's whole justification is the emulator superset
     invariant — `tests/test_wide_profile.sh` / `test_mame_wide.sh` are the
     gates, plus `test_crypt_boundary.sh` since the window's EDGE is what
     would move). Deficit to cover if nothing else changes: **125,560 bytes**.
  3. **Ship two tenants, Pyron aside.** Explicitly a LAST RESORT. Note the
     measured irony: Pyron's reach-constrained set is **0 bytes** — he is the
     cheapest tenant on every axis except his `anim` (111,872). Dropping any
     one tenant frees roughly its own anim, so on space grounds alone the
     choice between them is close to arbitrary; it is a roster decision, not
     an engineering one.

- ~~**THE MERGED BUILD'S `[init_shim]`: ONE SHIM, THREE TENANTS (14z-77)**~~
  **DECIDED 2026-08-10 (maintainer): the recommendation below, in full** —
  adopt phase mode, dispatch flavor per id, gate the write so Pyron stays
  untouched until his polarity is measured against native, then run Donovan's
  battery on a phase-mode build before trusting the merge. **IMPLEMENTED as
  slice G** (14z-77e); the two measurements it names remain OPEN and are
  listed there. Original entry follows.

  Surfaced by slice F's collision measurement — it was one of the three real
  merge blockers, and unlike the other two it was not purely mechanical.

  **The mechanics, measured.** The shim is emitted ONCE per build at ONE site
  (`dispatch_00`'s seed hook, `seed_entry = 0x016C64` — identical in both
  manifests that declare it). It (a) seeds the object pool if the latch is
  clear, and (b) writes the VS2/VH2 **flavor** byte to `+0x3C2` of the player
  struct being initialised, or `flavor_held` when that player's Start is held.

  Three things follow, and only the first is mechanical:

  1. **Flavor polarity is per tenant and already ratified.** D1 (VS2 default)
     means `0x01` for Donovan and `0x00` for Phobos — the polarity differs
     because the engine branch each character tests differs (14z-66 measured
     it against native). A merged shim must write the id-appropriate byte,
     i.e. the same N-way dispatch the thunks need. No decision required.
  2. **`latch_mode = "phase"` is NOT per tenant — the seeder is shared, so a
     merged build either has the gate or does not.** Phobos NEEDS it: without
     it his ecosystem drains pool 0 and the round-2 char re-init re-runs the
     seeder over LIVE pools (14z-65 measured the f4890 wipe, orphaned queues,
     and a freed slot dispatched into palette space). He is in the merged
     build, so **the merged build must carry the gate**, and Donovan's shim
     bytes therefore change — the generator's own comment says his frozen
     bytes stand "until his own re-freeze adopts the mode". The gate only
     narrows WHEN the seed runs (to `$FF800C == 0x40000`, the char-load
     phase), and Donovan's first init is at that phase, so it SHOULD be inert
     for him — but that is an argument, not a measurement, and this project
     does not ship arguments. **Required before the merged build is trusted:
     Donovan's replay battery on a phase-mode build, compared to
     donovan-m3a.**
  3. **Pyron declares NO `[init_shim]` at all.** In a merged build the shim
     runs at char-init for whatever the hosted dispatch covers, so he could
     be given a `+0x3C2` flavor byte he has never had. Whether he reads that
     byte is UNMEASURED. Options: give him an explicit row (needs his own
     polarity measured against native vs2, the 14z-66 procedure), or gate the
     flavor write so only tenants that declare one receive it.

  **Recommendation:** adopt phase mode for the merged build (2 is forced),
  dispatch the flavor bytes per id (1), and gate the write so Pyron is
  untouched until his polarity is measured (3, the conservative half) — then
  measure Donovan's battery before trusting the merged build. The alternative
  worth the maintainer's attention: if Donovan's battery DOES move under phase
  mode, the fallback is a per-id gate on the phase check itself, which is more
  emitted code at a shared site and wants explicit sign-off.

- ~~**THE BEAM'S LIST-TYPE 12: FLATTEN, OR RATIFY THE HOOK? (14z-71)**~~
  **DECIDED 2026-08-09 (maintainer): NEITHER — take over the dead
  list-type 6**, with the explicit condition that the deadness assumption
  must not be load-bearing. Built as `build/hui20`; see the 14z-71
  RESOLVED section. The maintainer's framing, kept because it generalises:
  *"there is almost always a chance it actually wasn't dead and we just
  missed how it was used... if we encounter regressions in vanilla
  assets/engine, this is one of the first places to check, and should we
  ever encounter something that uses list-type 6 that we didn't know of,
  we should stop, analyse and assess the situation before continuing."*
  That is now enforced by construction (the vanilla fallback) and by a
  gate (the `$FF010C` tripwire), not by memory. See THE DEADNESS REGISTER
  below.

- **THE 14z-62e SELECT-ART ANALYSIS (decided above).** The
  last visual-de-substitution piece: the tenant's select-art subset (101
  bank-1 tiles + 4 placeholder label tiles + the 6-tile medallion) still
  overwrites Jedah's bank-1 select-figure art, garbling his select-screen
  BODY (face/name/match art are all back). Two measured options:

  **A — a per-hover bank thunk + group C (recommended).** The select
  FIGURE object's bank already follows the hovered char through the
  engine table (measured: `PRG:0x05F9EC` jsr's the bank helper; hovering
  the tenant writes 0x1000 and his standing figure draws from group C
  TODAY). The PORTRAIT-record object instead gets bank 1 ONCE at venue
  init (`PRG:0x07C428`). Option A thunks the per-hover record-pointer
  consumers (`PRG:0x05F328`/`0x06C0E0`) to also set that object's bank:
  hovered==tenant -> 0x1000, else -> 0x2000 (the value it already holds,
  so pure-legacy RAM is byte-identical; after a tenant visit the restore
  re-converges). Select art then lives in group C at native codes — NO
  fit problem — and `vsav.zip` leaves the rompath ENTIRELY PRISTINE.
  Cost: a new engine hook on the select path (cycle-only for legacy; the
  ratified hook class, but the re-freeze's flicker/window inventory must
  be re-measured with it in — the standing watch applies). The name/
  highlight-piece objects' banks need the same treatment (their sites
  are one measurement away, same method).

  **B — relocate into blank bank-1 space, no hooks.** Vanilla bank 1 has
  2,917 blank tiles (largest runs: 881 at 0xBE90-0xC200, 460 at 0x3634,
  357 at 0x6C9C — measured). Placing the ~117 tiles there needs a NEW
  greedy fit (block-geometry aware), a reference-exclusivity proof for
  the chosen ranges (blank != unreferenced: a legacy record could use
  blank tiles as transparent filler, and art there would APPEAR — the
  proof method is the medallion's whole-image scan), and `vsav.zip`
  stays patched-but-additive (nothing of Jedah's overwritten). Zero
  engine hooks, zero legacy cycle cost.

  **Recommendation: A.** It finishes the artifact story (pristine
  vsav.zip — the strongest possible provenance), reuses the established
  thunk pattern and the already-poked bank table, and avoids a new fit +
  exclusivity-proof toolchain for a one-off. The hook's legacy cost is
  cycles only, in the class the basis already tolerates; it will be
  measured before the re-freeze ratifies anything. B stays the fallback
  if the measured hook cost violates the standing watch.

- ~~**RATIFY A COMPOSITE §4 CLASS? (14z-61)**~~ **RATIFIED 2026-08-06
  (maintainer: "Your proposal is ratified").** CLAUDE.md §4 amended: the
  `composite` class is the strict CONJUNCTION of flicker-tolerated and
  bounded re-convergent window, adding no tolerance to either. The seven
  `.pending` expectations became `.masked` `composite` specs carrying the
  shapes they had already printed, and the WIDE reference freeze is
  complete — `run_suite.sh` on `donovan-m5w` is GREEN, all 63 replays
  validated or explicitly skipped. Original entry below.

- **RATIFY A COMPOSITE §4 CLASS? (14z-61) — the analysis behind the
  decision above.** Seven legacy replays measure as the frozen
  hook-flicker inventory PLUS one bounded re-convergent window per
  select-screen ENTRY (table in 14z-61). Both halves are already ratified —
  `flicker` (§4 v2) and `window` (§4 v3) — but no single class expresses
  their conjunction, so those replays cannot be frozen without either a new
  class or a fudge. They are `.pending` and fail the suite meanwhile.

  **Proposal: `composite <baseset> <flicker-csv> <window-list>`**, defined
  as the strict CONJUNCTION of the two: every divergent run must be
  accounted for by name, the flicker set must match the frozen inventory
  exactly, the window list must match exactly, and the run must fully
  re-converge. It tolerates nothing that `flicker` and `window` do not each
  tolerate, and it is strictly stronger than either alone.

  Implemented and ground-truthed ahead of the decision so ratification is
  one word rather than a session: `tools/compare_composite.py`,
  `tests/test_compare_composite.sh` (7 synthetic cases + a no-loophole
  check — extra flicker frame FAILS, missing flicker frame FAILS, onset
  moved one frame FAILS, no re-convergence FAILS, bit-identical FAILS, an
  unfrozen second window FAILS). **Nothing validates against it until you
  say so**: accepting means turning each `.pending` file into a `.masked`
  one carrying the spec it already prints.

  **Recommendation: ratify.** The alternative readings are worse — calling
  these replays `skip` hides a real comparison, and widening `flicker` to
  swallow a 900-frame run would be the loosening §4's standing watch exists
  to prevent.

- ~~**FREEZE THE WIDE TRACK? (14z-61).**~~ **DONE 2026-08-05 (maintainer:
  "yes freeze and register as wide reference first, then we resume").**
  `9bac6ee3 -> donovan-m5w`; see 14z-61. Original entry below.

- **FREEZE THE WIDE TRACK? (14z-61) — the analysis behind the decision.** `build/m5_wide` (`9bac6ee3`) is now
  playtest-confirmed with and without Donovan, both WIDE profile gates are
  green, and the new rendering + member-identity gates are green. The
  registry convention is that rows are added at FREEZE time as a STATE.md
  decision, so this is not mine to do.
  **Recommendation: freeze and register it** as the WIDE reference
  (`donovan-m5w` alongside `donovan-m2c`), for one specific reason beyond
  bookkeeping: M3a moves the tenant from `0x0F` to `0x13` and will churn
  the select records, the thunk id and the bank-table row at once. Without
  a registered WIDE reference, a regression during that work has nothing to
  bisect against on this track — which is exactly the position that made
  the sprite garble expensive.
  Cost if we skip it: none today; the risk is only felt later, and by then
  the build may not be reproducible from the tree.

- **THE SELECT SCREEN AND THE SUPERSET INVARIANT (14z-60r).** Drawing three
  new medallions requires the wheel OBJ record to grow from 18 to 21
  entries and its coordinate list likewise. Measured: neither can grow in
  place (another record starts immediately at `0x272ABA`; the coord list is
  immediately followed by the shared global pool), so both must relocate —
  cheap, one referrer at `PRG:0x2689FE`. **The problem is not placement, it
  is the invariant.**

  The record's `count` word changes and its `budget` word is debited from
  the OBJ emitter's shared per-frame budget — GOTCHAS records that exact
  coupling flipping a borderline skip decision into a one-byte work-RAM
  divergence. Three more sprites also render. **So any legacy replay that
  reaches the select screen will diverge in RAM.** M2b's select work avoided
  this by strict in-place replacement preserving the host's budget word;
  adding CELLS makes that impossible by construction.

  CLAUDE.md §1 covers "any match, **menu path**, or attract sequence", so
  this needs an explicit ruling rather than an assumption:

  **A — a bounded select-screen carve-out (recommended).** Legacy replays
  are compared as today up to select entry, and the select-screen
  divergence is MEASURED, mechanism-attributed and frozen per replay, in
  the same style as the existing `diverge` constants and masked windows.
  Rationale: the invariant's purpose is that vanilla *gameplay* is
  untouched, and a select screen that offers three more characters is by
  definition content that involves them. Condition: the divergence is
  measured and frozen BEFORE acceptance, never accepted blind, and must not
  extend past the select screen into match state.

  **B — keep the wheel vanilla**, reach the newcomers by another mechanism
  (the option-2 hold-Start alternates the maintainer already ranked lower).
  Preserves the invariant literally; costs the decided roster UX.

  **C — attempt a RAM-neutral extension.** Not viable: the budget word must
  cover the entries actually emitted, and three extra sprites change OBJ RAM
  regardless. Recorded so it is not re-proposed.

  **Recommendation: A**, with the measurement done first so the ruling is
  made on a number rather than on a prediction.

  **MEASURED 2026-08-05 (14z-60s), and the number is good.** Built
  (`select_wheel roster21`) and compared against the previous WIDE build on
  the masked basis, so the wheel change is the only variable:

  | replay | frames | divergent | window | after |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `04_select_fuzz` | 3520 | 162 | 890-1051 | 2469 identical |
  | `02_demitri_vs_cpu` | 5520 | 733 | 890-1622 | 3898 identical |
  | `03_two_player_vs` | 5320 | 913 | 890-1802 | 3518 identical |
  | `09_mirror_pick` | 4720 | 993 | 890-1882 | 2838 identical |
  | `05_timeout_idle` | 12120 | 733 | 890-1622 | 10498 identical |

  Every replay: **onset at frame 890 — select-screen entry — exactly ONE
  contiguous run, and FULL RE-CONVERGENCE.** Match state is bit-identical
  in all five, including a complete timeout match (10,498 identical frames
  after the window closes). The divergence is confined to the screen we
  deliberately changed and reaches nothing else.

  That is a **stronger** guarantee than the existing frozen-`diverge`
  class, which never re-converges at all. The proposal for ratification is
  therefore a new comparison class: **"bounded select-screen window,
  re-convergent"** — onset frame, window end and run-count frozen per
  replay, with re-convergence and match-state identity as the assertions.
  Mechanism: select-screen init caches the record pointer we repointed
  (`GOTCHAS` class 4), which is why onset is identical across replays.

- ~~**THE `0x360+id` ANIM BLOCK (14z-60)**~~ **DECIDED 2026-08-05
  (maintainer): option A, INHERIT — "since we can. If it fails, we'll
  fall back to option B (relocation)."** So a newcomer at `0x13` plays
  anim `0x363` from the shared `0x360-0x36F` block, exactly as vsav2
  ships; sites `PRG:0x003E40` and `PRG:0x004082` stay folded and are
  recorded as `inherit` in the tenant manifest. Fallback if playtest shows
  the inherited animation is wrong for a newcomer: relocate the block to a
  free 32-wide anim-number range and widen both masks. Original write-up
  kept below.

- **THE `0x360+id` ANIM BLOCK (14z-60) — the analysis behind the decision
  above** — of the seven sites that fold the
  character id to 4 bits, five are ordinary porting work; two
  (`PRG:0x003E40`, `PRG:0x004082`) compute a per-character anim number in a
  block that is genuinely 16 wide (`0x360-0x36F`, with `0x370+` already
  occupied). **Option A: inherit** — a newcomer at `0x13` plays `0x363`,
  which is exactly what vsav2 ships, Capcom having left both folds in
  place. **Option B: relocate** the block to a free 32-wide range and widen
  both sites — a numbering audit plus shared-engine edits, for a family we
  cannot yet name. **Recommendation: A**, on the strength of vs2 being a
  shipped existence proof; revisit only if a playtest shows the inherited
  animation is wrong for a newcomer. Detail in session 14z-60 and
  `docs/game/atlas/id_space.md`.

- ~~**M5 SOUND NEEDS A DATA HOME (14z-52)**~~ **SETTLED 2026-08-04 by the
  dual-track decision below: it lives in `wide_ext`.** Two corrections to
  the record that got it there:
  **(a) Option B was DEAD and the recommendation was wrong.** It proposed
  reclaiming the "inert since 14z-31" `weapon_accent_t0/_t1/rowd_slot`
  rows. Measured 14z-59g: those are `data_port` rows writing 0x20 bytes
  each to `0x39FBE0-0x39FC40`, which is in NEITHER hole (`hole_a`
  `0x0BF6A0-0x100000`, `hole_b` `0x3EC720-0x400000`). They are in-place
  palette overwrites, not hole allocations, so reclaiming them frees
  **zero** of the 352 bytes needed. The original entry mistook them for
  hole tenants.
  **(b) Option C stopped being expensive.** It was rejected as "larger
  blast radius" before WIDE existed; WIDE is now demonstrated on both
  emulators, so it is the cheap option — and option A (Jedah's anim
  region) keeps its unaudited dead space AND stays available for the
  ported select web, which was its earmarked purpose all along.

- ~~**M5 VOICE SAMPLES (14z-51)**~~ **DECIDED 2026-08-04 (maintainer):
  "A then B, gates stay strict, option C is rejected."** Ship M5 with those
  specific sounds silent now (option A — it matches the current
  silent-by-design behaviour for exactly the sounds that cannot be
  faithful); revisit growing the QSound sample region (option B) at M3,
  when Huitzil and Pyron force the same question at scale, inside the
  measured 16 MB ceiling. **Option C (overwriting low-value vsav content)
  is rejected** and may not be re-proposed — it is superset-invariant-
  adjacent. Original entry with the full option analysis kept below.

- **M5 VOICE SAMPLES (14z-51) — the analysis behind the decision above:**
  6-8 of Donovan's sounds (his voice
  lines / vs2-new sfx: ids 0x71D/0x73E/0x753-0x756, likely the "Change
  Immortal" family) do not exist in vsav's sample ROMs, which are
  byte-full. Options: A) ship M5 with those specific sounds silent
  (shared sfx all restorable regardless); B) grow the QSound sample
  region via driver descriptor (vm3.11m/12m from 4MB->8MB members or
  add members; CLAUDE.md rule 1 permits load-map changes; MiSTer
  impact unknown); C) overwrite low-value vsav content (risky,
  superset-invariant-adjacent). Recommendation: A now (matches the
  current "silent by design" behavior for exactly the sounds that
  cannot be faithful), revisit B at M3 when Huitzil/Pyron force the
  same question at scale.
  **UPDATED 14z-59f — option B now has a measured hard ceiling.** CPS-2
  WIDE v1 already declares QSound at **16 MB, which is MAME's maximum**
  (`qsound_device` is a `device_rom_interface<24>`, 24 address bits). So
  B is available and proven on both emulators up to 16 MB and NOT ONE
  BYTE further: growing past it would mean widening a SHARED MAME device,
  which is outside Rule 1 v2. If Donovan + Huitzil + Pyron voice banks do
  not fit in the 8 MB the profile adds, the answer has to be exclusivity
  or banking, not more region. Worth sizing that before committing to B
  at M3. (Two duplicate copies of this entry were merged here.)

- ~~**ROSTER ACCESS MECHANISM**~~ **DECIDED 2026-08-04: option 1, an
  altered select screen keeping the existing cells and appending the three
  newcomers; hold-Start alternates are the fallback. See 14z-59l.**

- See SPEC §7 for the rest. Nothing blocks current work.

- ~~**THE REPOSITORY LICENCE (14z-106).**~~ **DECIDED (maintainer,
  2026-08-22): GPL-3.0 for everything** — `LICENSE` added (the FSF text
  verbatim), README "Licence" section. Original entry: The tree has no LICENSE file.
  The jtcores fork is GPL-3.0 by obligation; the licence of THIS tree
  (tools, patches, docs, authored assets — never ROM bytes, rule 7) is
  undecided. Options: GPL-3.0 across the board (simplest, one licence
  for the whole deliverable); MIT/BSD for tools + GPL-3.0 only for the
  core fork (more permissive tooling, two licences to explain); CC for
  docs/assets on top of either. RECOMMENDATION: GPL-3.0 for the whole
  tree — one licence, compatible with the core by construction, and the
  maintainer's stated wish is FOSS. Maintainer's call.


## Moved 14z-128 (2026-09-03) — four entries that had stopped shaping work

Verbatim from STATE.md's "Decisions pending": the session-series ruling (its own
text says "This entry is now history"), the frame-data privacy rule (implemented
14z-126), the DF-startup question (answered by measurement 14z-126, no change
needed) and the CLAUDE.md condensing pass (pass 2 done 14z-124).

- **A NEW SESSION SERIES — DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-09-02): (d) KEEP `14z-`.**
  *"yes, we keep 14z- for the reasons found in previous sessions."* No seam,
  no second namespace, no regex change: `tools/gen_gate_index.py`'s
  `SESSION_RE` and `tools/checkdocshape.py`'s `SESSION_TOKEN`/`CHRONO` keep
  matching every tag, past and future, and the [VSP-162] documentation of the
  prefix is what resolves the confusion that opened this. The next session is
  `14z-127`. **This entry is now history; the reasoning is kept below.**
  Recorded 2026-09-01 as: RESOLVED TOWARD (d), awaiting the one-word confirm.** The maintainer: "I like
  S127 but if there's a risk, even low, I don't mind keeping the 14z prefix
  honestly." **THE RECOMMENDATION FLIPPED FROM (a) TO (d), and NOT on the
  risk** — the risk is the wrong axis. The `checkdocshape`-blindness failure
  is a known three-line change that a must-fire control eliminates, which is
  this project's own standard for "not a risk"; residual is only an unknown
  fourth consumer (405 files grepped, 3 parses found). **The real reason is
  that the BENEFIT collapsed when the prefix was DOCUMENTED an hour earlier:**
  [VSP-162] fixes the confusion by explaining it, so a reader is un-confused
  in ten seconds, and what a rename adds beyond that is cosmetic legibility —
  bought at a PERMANENT second namespace and a seam that every future grep and
  reader must know, which no control removes. For a key whose whole value is
  resolving cleanly, a boundary is an ongoing cost against a cosmetic gain.
  If it is ever wanted, the cheap moment is a NATURAL BOUNDARY (a new
  milestone, or the MiSTer arc closing), not mid-arc. The options as put:** The existing keys are SETTLED:
  they stay as they are, resolvable forever ([VSP-162]). This is only about
  what the NEXT session is called. **Why it is even on the table:** the
  maintainer read [VSP-162] as written and asked "why are we still on session
  14?" — the prefix is fossilised and actively misleads (session 14 was ONE
  sitting, 2026-07-28, the M2a freeze; MiSTer opened 104 sessions later at
  `14z-106`).
  **Options:**
  **(a) RECOMMENDED — `S127`: drop the dead prefix, KEEP the live counter and
  the whole grammar** (letter suffix = continuation `S127b`; parenthetical =
  phase `S127 (3)`). The seam is one line — "S127 immediately follows
  14z-126b" — chronological order is preserved, every existing habit carries
  over, and nothing in the archive moves.
  **(b) Restart at `S1`. NOT RECOMMENDED: it COLLIDES** with the early bare
  integers still live in the archive (`Session 3`, `4`, `5-6`, `7`, `9`,
  `13`, `14`), so `S1`..`S14` would be ambiguous to exactly the greps the key
  exists to serve.
  **(c) Date-based (`2026-09-01a`).** Self-describing, but sessions are
  context windows (~8/day measured), so it needs letter suffixes anyway and
  buys nothing the counter does not.
  **(d) Do nothing** — defensible; the prefix is inert and now documented, so
  the confusion it caused is a one-time cost already paid.
  **THE COST, MEASURED 2026-09-01 (and it is small but has a TRAP):** of 405
  files mentioning `14z`, only THREE are PARSES —
  `tools/gen_gate_index.py:60` (`SESSION_RE`) and `tools/checkdocshape.py:78`
  and `:79` (`SESSION_TOKEN`, `CHRONO`). Everything else is prose citation,
  which is exactly why renaming old keys is forbidden and why a NEW series is
  nearly free. **THE TRAP: `checkdocshape`'s two regexes are the gate that
  bars a REFERENCE doc from re-accreting chronology (built 14z-126b). A new
  prefix not added there makes that gate SILENTLY BLIND to the new tags** —
  green while checking nothing, the failure mode that let eight freezes of
  chronology accrete in HANDOFF unseen. So the ruling, if it is (a), lands as
  ONE commit: three regexes extended + a must-fire control proving the new
  prefix is caught + the seam line in [VSP-162] and the port skill. No
  gameplay surface; the maintainer's convention, so theirs to rule.

- **FRAME DATA IN A PUBLIC REPO — DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-31: "I agree
  with the recommendation") AND IMPLEMENTED 14z-126, option (b).** THE CLASS
  RULE: every per-move ROM-derived table — OURS AND THIRD-PARTY ALIKE — is
  generator output kept OUT of the public tree; the tree ships the READERS
  and the VERDICTS, and currency is locked by hash instead of by publishing
  the numbers. What moved to `../charpages/framedata/` (new producer
  `tools/framedata_pages.sh`, which refuses an in-repo output dir):
  `<tenant>_anim.md` ×3, `<tenant>.html` ×3 (the artifacts are published from
  there now), `community_crosscheck_full.md` (the move-by-move comparison),
  `vanilla_hit_damage.tsv`. What STAYS in the tree: the generators, the
  verdict rows (`tests/expected/community_crosscheck.txt`, 91), the measured
  slot map (chain ids, not frame data), the mechanisms and "What is NOT
  known", and two new hash locks — `tests/expected/charmap_pages.sha256` (6)
  and `tests/expected/vanilla_hit_damage.sha256`. The committed
  `community_crosscheck.md` is now the VERDICT-ONLY rendering (1060 → 359
  lines, zero per-move value rows, no workbook values). History is ACCEPTED,
  not rewritten (the maintainer's call; a rewrite of pushed `main` was not
  done). The original entry follows.
  **The proposal, as recorded before the ruling:** The repo is PUBLIC
  (`DefinitelyFrenchName/VampireSaved`). The maintainer's position, in
  substance: frame data has been published in community docs and in
  Capcom-sanctioned mooks, so the DIFFS forwarded to the community are fine,
  but we should refrain from publishing the data ourselves — remove the
  public documents that carry it, keep them private, and instead ship TOOLS
  that regenerate the frame-data documentation from the romsets, as the
  character pages already do (`tools/charpages_internal.sh` -> `../charpages/`);
  argued as beneficial because the focus moves to the validity of the
  reader/interpreter and the documentation can never go stale. Claude's
  assessment (given in session): agree with the direction — it is [VSP-12]'s
  GENERATED-doc law applied one step further — with four riders: (1)
  regeneration guarantees CURRENCY, not correctness — both 14z-125 defects
  were interpretation defects a hash-locked page would have reproduced; the
  in-emulator rigs (`test_vanilla_frame_join`, the hit rig) stay the validity
  gates and carry no tables; (2) draw the line by CLASS, not file: per-move
  ROM-derived numbers live today in `community_crosscheck.md` (ours + the
  workbook's), the three tenant `_anim.md`/`.html` pages, and
  `tests/expected/vanilla_hit_damage.tsv` — the 91-row
  `community_crosscheck.txt` is already verdict-shaped; (3) the workbook's
  OWN values stay out regardless (the compilation is the author's work) —
  the delta-only `render_md` fix; (4) removing a file from HEAD does not
  remove it from the PUBLIC history (24 pushed commits) — accept-in-history
  is the recommendation; a rewrite of pushed `main` is destructive and the
  maintainer's alone. **Options:** (a) third-party values only out, ours
  stay; (b) RECOMMENDED — every per-move ROM-derived table (ours and theirs)
  becomes generator output under `../charpages/` via one route
  (`tools/framedata_pages.sh` beside `charpages_internal.sh`), the in-tree
  `community_crosscheck.md` keeps verdicts / mechanisms / counts /
  "What is NOT known" only, the tenant pages move to the same route, gates
  lock SHA-256s of the regenerated output under ROMDIR plus the verdict rows;
  (c) leave as is. Half a session for (b); the class boundary and the
  history question are the maintainer's to rule.
- **DF-STARTUP INVINCIBILITY FOR THE TENANTS — ANSWERED 14z-126, MEASURED,
  NO CHANGE NEEDED (DECIDED by measurement; nothing to rule unless a window
  is to be retuned).** The window is `+0x147` (the victim's invincibility
  timer, the hit test's gate at `PRG:0x018064`), armed PER CHARACTER by the
  seq-0x16 handler `dispatch_16` selects — NEITHER global (the shared body
  arms only `+0x143` = 0x14, the throw immunity) NOR inherited (the tenants'
  rows are repointed to their own vs2 handlers): Donovan 64 ticks (Victor 59),
  Huitzil 79 (Bulleta 41), Pyron 41 (Demitri 41, coincident by value). All 15
  vanilla values measured and frozen too (`tests/expected/df_startup_invuln.tsv`,
  gate `tests/audit_df_startup_invuln.sh`; engine_internals "Dark Force" ->
  "The STARTUP INVINCIBILITY window"). Natively on vs2: no window at all
  ([VSE-69]). Retuning a tenant is one data byte in its ported handler, if
  ever wanted. The original entry follows. **RECORDED, not started — and it is THE NEXT ARC
  (maintainer, 2026-08-31: the DF question first, then the Zabel j.LK patch,
  then Jedah's crouching recovery).** THE MAINTAINER SHARPENED IT (2026-08-31):
  not just *do the tenants have the startup invincibility*, but **if they do, is
  it a GLOBAL property of the DF activation or is it INHERITED FROM THE SHELL
  CHARACTER?** That third possibility is the one the tree makes most likely and
  the measurement plan below did not name: the tenants sit at variant ids
  `0x10`/`0x11`/`0x13`, which ALIAS base-half rows in every table vsavj did not
  repoint ([VSE-10]), so a flag read from an id-indexed row would hand Phobos
  Bulleta's, Pyron Demitri's and Donovan Victor's. **So the rig needs three
  legs, not two: the tenant, its SHELL character, and a legacy control** — if
  the tenant matches its shell rather than its vs2 self, the answer is
  inheritance and the fix is a repoint, not a port. The original question: do the VS2
  tenants get the invulnerable STARTUP window vanilla characters get at Dark
  Force activation? What the tree knows: activation is the shared body
  `PRG:0x027000` (seq 0x16, one stock) followed by the PER-CHARACTER
  `dispatch_16` row (`PRG:0x0BF31A`) — the tenants' rows are repointed to
  their ported vs2 handlers, which were written for vs2's DIFFERENT DF system
  ([VSE-69], `oracle`-independent: `engine_internals.md` "Dark Force"). So if
  the window is armed in the shared body the tenants inherit it; if it is
  armed in the per-character handler, they do not — that is the seam to
  measure. `ram.md` names `+0x11E/+0x134/+0x145/+0x1A4` as
  "invulnerability/status flags", class [C] (a candidate, never verified).
  Measurement (T3, half a session): replay 97's activation rig
  (`tests/replays/df/97_df_mech.rpl`, `audit_df_framework.sh`) with the
  opponent's attack timed to land INSIDE the startup window, legacy control
  Demitri (expect no hit) vs each tenant, positive control = the same attack
  landing outside the window; instrument = field_trace of `+0x54` /
  HP / the four flag bytes across the window; freeze as
  `tests/audit_df_startup_invuln.sh`. If a tenant lacks it, the fix is a
  GAMEPLAY decision ([VSP-10]) under the DF ruling above ("adjustments per
  character, never to the general mechanic") — options then: (a) arm the
  vanilla flag from the tenant's ported handler (a thunk on our own code,
  legacy-clean by construction); (b) accept. No recommendation before the
  measurement.
- **THE CLAUDE.md CONDENSING PASS (maintainer-directed 2026-08-30, 14z-122
  close). PASS 1 DONE 14z-123 (441 → 414 lines; narratives → rule + citation;
  anchors and headers intact). PASS 2 DECIDED (maintainer, 2026-08-31: "Then
  do the CLAUDE.md pass 2") AND DONE 14z-124 — (a)+(b)+(c) as recommended:
  414 → 344 lines; [VSP-27..30] live in `docs/project/oracle_classes.md`
  (the spec of record, 105 lines), the document roster in `docs/README.md`
  "The documents, by role", the recordings how-to in HANDOFF; §4/§5 keep the
  law and point; census re-frozen for the four moved anchors. ~~PASS 2 NEEDS
  A RULING~~ — the remaining bulk is
  law-dense, and the honest next cut is STRUCTURAL, by the file's own Rule 1 v2
  principle ("the spec is NOT copied here — two copies drift"): (a) §4's five
  oracle-class definitions ([VSP-27]..[VSP-31], ~75 lines) → a canonical
  `docs/project/oracle_classes.md`, §4 keeping the class NAMES, the standing
  watch and a pointer (the anchors move with the paragraphs; the port skill's
  D.2 rules cite "§4 v1/v2..v5" and would cite the new document; census
  re-frozen); (b) §5's document taxonomy list → `docs/README.md`'s routing
  table, §5 keeping the one-question rule and a pointer (~30 lines); (c) the
  recordings rule's operational how-to (the run/playback commands) → HANDOFF,
  the rule keeping capture-first, naming and cleanup (~10 lines). Estimated
  end state ~290 lines. Recommendation: (a) and (b); (c) is marginal.
  Nothing in pass 2 is Claude's to decide — it moves anchored law out of the
  constitution.** The original ruling: The maintainer's words, in substance: CLAUDE.md
  "has become very big and looks to have been extended like a log. This is
  not bad but wastes resources: we should plan a pass on it to remove
  duplicates if any and rewrite the contents in a more concise and to the
  point manner, without losing precious information, especially on the work
  style and discipline." Constraints the pass's tooling already enforces:
  CLAUDE.md carries **30 `**[VSP-N]**` anchors** (checkskills + the census
  freeze every one by section) and is a LOG for VSP skill numbers — every
  rewrite keeps each marker with its fact or moves the rule ([VSP-13]-grade
  discipline; the census diff is the review artifact). Shape suggestion to
  ratify at the pass: the LAW (rules 1-8, §4's classes, §5's standing
  orders) stays verbatim-precise; the CORRECTION NARRATIVES appended inside
  rules (the 14z-91/94/110b/114 stories) condense to the rule + a dated
  citation, with the narrative in the docs that already carry it. ~~Slot:
  before G7 (the close bumps floors; the law should settle first).~~ (G7
  CLOSED 14z-124 without it — pass 2 stands alone, no slot constraint.)
