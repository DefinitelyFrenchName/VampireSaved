description: The CPS-2 layer of driving MAME and FBNeo as instruments - since 14z-134 a THIN layer. Every one of its 42 rules turned out to be true of MAME/FBNeo on any board, so all 42 were lifted to the board-agnostic mame-fbneo-instruments skill ([MFI-N] lifts [CPE-N], same number) and this file keeps each CPE ID as a redirect so citations resolve. Load mame-fbneo-instruments for the rules; load this to resolve a [CPE-N] citation or to find the CPS-2-specific emulator facts, which live in cps2-hardware ([CPH-23], [CPH-25]) and mister-cps2-wide-core ([MSC-32]). Game-independent; the board's own laws are cps2-hardware, the project's rigs are vampire-saved-port.

# CPS-2 emulation — MAME and FBNeo as instruments (level 1, game-independent)

Agent-facing rules, IDs `[CPE-NN]`, each ANCHORED `**[CPE-NN]**` at the
paragraph of `docs/platform/gotchas.md`, `docs/project/gotchas.md`,
`docs/project/cps2_wide.md` or `HANDOFF.md` it distils, locked by
`tools/checkskills.py`.

**THE 14z-134 LEVEL-0 CUT, and what it found about this skill.** Asked of
every rule, "would this still be true if the board were not CPS-2?" was
answered YES for all 42: `-debug` timing, watchpoint spaces, tap
alignment, focus theft, hash-before-name member resolution, the pinned
source builds, the shared EEPROM, the two-implementation protocol — none of
it is a CPS-2 fact. They now live in **`mame-fbneo-instruments` as
`[MFI-N]`, N unchanged**, and this file is a REDIRECT TABLE: each `[CPE-N]`
below stays DEFINED (the doc paragraph carries both anchors, `**[CPE-N]**
**[MFI-N]**`) so the citations in gate headers, docs and archives keep
resolving, and `tools/checkskills.py` fails if a redirect is deleted. The
CPS-2-SPECIFIC emulator facts were never here: the loaders' shape rules
are `[CPH-23]`, the reserved window's per-implementation reads `[CPH-25]`,
the complemented key-range word `[MSC-32]`. The theme the rules share,
paid for more than any other in this project: **an emulator reports
success while measuring something else.** Board laws are `[CPH-NN]`;
which rig to reach for is the port skill; the FPGA lane is `[MSC-NN]`.
