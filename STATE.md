# STATE — living progress log

Updated: 2026-07-25 (M0 kickoff session — bench built and green)

## Current milestone

M0 — Bench. **COMPLETE** (2026-07-25). Acceptance status:
- Null-patch output bit-identical to reference: **PASS** (`tests/test_null_build.sh`)
- 60s attract replay deterministic across two runs: **PASS** (`tests/test_attract_determinism.sh`, MAME)
- Headless MAME runner: **DONE** (`tools/run_mame.sh`, MAME 0.288 via Homebrew)
- Headless FBNeo runner: **DONE** (`emu/fbneo` submodule, SDL2 build,
  `tools/run_fbneo.sh` with dummy SDL drivers + sandboxed HOME;
  `tests/test_fbneo_smoke.sh` PASS). The SDL2 frontend has no scripting, so
  the per-frame RAM-checksum probe on the FBNeo side is a frontend patch —
  first M1 task (see below)

Bonus beyond plan: CPS-2 decryption/encryption pipeline
(`tools/cps2_decrypt.py`) proven bit-identical to MAME's implementation via
opcode-space dump oracle (`tests/test_decrypt_oracle.sh`). Both directions
(decrypt for analysis, encrypt for future patch injection) self-check.

## Next actions

1. **FBNeo harness patch (M1 entry):** SDL2 frontend has replay
   (`replay.cpp`) and savestate support but no Lua. Options: (a) small
   frontend patch adding a per-frame work-RAM checksum dump + headless/exit
   flags (frontend, not emulation core — allowed); (b) drive via its .fr
   replay format only. Recommendation: (a); it mirrors the MAME Lua probe.
2. Start M1: three-way program diff (all three sets already decrypt
   bit-identically to the MAME oracle — images in `build/out/`), work-RAM
   map, character-data manifests.

## Open items

- None blocking. Reference collection is COMPLETE: vsav, vsavj, vsav2,
  vhunt2, vhunt2r1, qsound_hle — all MAME `-verifyroms` green, all 76
  members frozen in `docs/checksums.txt` (vsav2 supplied by maintainer
  mid-session 2026-07-25 and folded in; re-freeze recorded here).
- ROM packaging fixes from the 2026-07-25 audit are confirmed applied:
  `vhunt2.key` present in both vhunt2 zips (CRC 61306b20), `qsound_hle.zip`
  present (`dl-1425.bin` CRC d6cf5ef5).

## Decisions made

- **Project name = "Vampire Saved"** — 2026-07-25, maintainer.
- **Base revision = `vsavj` (Japan 970519)** — 2026-07-24, maintainer. Closed.
- **Checksum manifest is per-member**, so zip repackaging never matters —
  2026-07-25, session decision (mechanical, no gameplay impact).
- **Raw-image byte-order convention** — 2026-07-25, session decision: ROM
  files are LE-word storage; all derived images are 68k logical (BE) order.
  See docs/GOTCHAS.md first entry.

## Decisions pending (human)

- See SPEC §7. None blocks M0 wrap-up or early M1 (diff/atlas work).

## Open bugs

None.

## Findings log

- 2026-07-25: key masters — vsavj `0xfa8f4e33a4b881b9` (watchdog
  `cmpi.l #$726A4BAF, D0`), vsav2 `0xd681e4f460371edf`, vhunt2
  `0x36c1eba326b10f18` (vsav2/vhunt2 share watchdog
  `cmpi.l #$06920760, D0` — sibling builds). All three: encrypted range
  `PRG:0x000000-0x0FFFFF` only (first 1MB of 4MB). Decryption of all three
  proven bit-identical to MAME (`tests/test_decrypt_oracle.sh <set>`).
- 2026-07-25: ROM file byte order ≠ 68k logical order; cost ~1h; conventions
  locked and oracle-tested (docs/GOTCHAS.md).
- 2026-07-25: MAME 0.288 vsavj boots and runs attract deterministically
  headless (`-video none -sound none`, fresh sandbox per run).

## Integration notes — SMS docs (imported 2026-07-24)

Conventions live in CLAUDE.md §4/§5 now; taxonomy files exist as of this
session. Still to mine when relevant (park, don't re-derive):
- SMS `coltest.lua` pattern (scripted char-select navigation → saved match
  state) for generating the 18×18 matrix states in M4.
- `trace.lua`/`trace_plan.lua` config shape for the CPS-2 input logger.
