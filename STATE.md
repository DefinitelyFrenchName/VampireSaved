# STATE — living progress log

Updated: 2026-07-25 (session 3 — §4 amended; D/H/P located; bank labeled)

## Session 3 highlights

- CLAUDE.md §4 dual-emulator amendment applied (maintainer-approved).
- **Donovan/Huitzil/Pyron located and pinned** (char IDs 0x13/0x10/0x11,
  hitbox bases + handler code addresses in both vsav2 and vhunt2).
- Per-character table bank semantically labeled (14 dispatch tables +
  hitbox pairs + parameter tables); bank layout identical across all three
  sets (same internal deltas from a per-set origin).
- RAM atlas: round timer $FF8109, HP +0x50/+0x52 (max 0x120), X/Y
  +0x10/+0x14 added.
- Remaining for M1 acceptance: per-character manifests' remaining columns
  (anim scripts, tile ranges, palettes, sound cues); meter/rounds-won RAM
  offsets; formal Aulbath slot-9 pick; vhunt2-side pick verification of
  D/H/P; Start-hold flavor mechanism (VS2-vs-VH2 behavioral deltas are NOT
  in hitbox data — identical across both games).

## Current milestone

**M1 — Map. ACCEPTED (2026-07-25).** Both SPEC §4 clauses met; full
assessment in docs/M1_acceptance.md. Deferred sprite-bound exact addresses
(tile/palette/sound) are proven-reachable and scoped to M3/M4/M5. Next: M2
(Donovan into vsavj by slot replacement) — pending maintainer's replaced-
slot sign-off (recommendation below).

### M1 detail (all complete)
- Replay harness: DONE both emulators. Shared `.rpl` input-script format;
  MAME runner (`tests/lua/replay.lua` — inputs, checksums, snapshots, RAM
  dumps) and patched-FBNeo runner (`emu/fbneo-patches/0001-…-harness.patch`,
  `tools/run_replay_fbneo.sh`). Both proven deterministic run-to-run.
- 10-replay legacy suite: DONE, green, expectations frozen
  (`tests/run_suite.sh`, `tests/expected/vsavj/`). Semantics spot-verified by
  snapshot (2P pick, challenger interrupt, mid-attract start all confirmed).
- **Cross-emulator finding (important):** MAME and FBNeo agree bit-exactly
  for the first 71 boot frames, then run the same states on *different frame
  indices* (transitions land ±frames apart; static screens re-sync; ~37
  work-RAM bytes differ at title — phase-shifted counters + sound-driver
  area $FF05xx). **Frame-exact whole-RAM dual-emulator comparison does not
  hold.** Superset-invariant enforcement is unaffected (oracle = same
  emulator, vanilla vs patched). Recommendation for CLAUDE.md §4 amendment
  (human sign-off requested, non-blocking): new-content dual-emulator
  verification = mapped gameplay fields (player structs, HP, positions,
  timer) compared at sync anchors (match start), not whole-RAM checksums.
- RAM map: community anchor imported and verified (player structs
  $FF8400/$FF8500, hitbox ptr offsets, match-active flags), extended by
  differential experiments + write-traces. See docs/atlas/ram.md.
- **Character-data plumbing CRACKED (the big one):** write-trace on
  $FF8480 → per-character loader (vsavj PRG:0x028DD8) → three 32-entry
  tables indexed by 5-bit char id → located in ALL THREE sets by
  instruction-pattern search → a whole bank of ~20 per-character tables
  (vsavj PRG:0x0BD0FA-0x0BE8xx). Slot→name map ~10/16 done empirically
  (pick + snapshot + pointer readback). Variant slots: vsavj {8}=Oboro
  Bishamon; vsav2/vhunt2 {0,1,3,8,9} with per-slot hitbox data
  byte-identical between vsav2 and vhunt2 (both games carry both flavors).
  **vsavj slot→character map COMPLETE** (16/16, one by elimination).
  **DONOVAN/HUITZIL/PYRON LOCATED** (pick-verified on vsav2): char IDs
  0x13/0x10/0x11 — the variant half of slots 3/0/1 — with hitbox bases in
  both vsav2 and vhunt2 recorded. Base-half slot assignments are identical
  across the whole series. Full detail: docs/atlas/character_tables.md.
- Three-way diff: window/masked diff built (`tools/diff_sets.py`);
  **finding:** vsavj↔vsav2 share <10% at window level even pointer-masked —
  engines were rebuilt (shifted code, changed PC-relative displacements) and
  most of the 4MB is game-specific data. The atlas grows from anchored
  RE (traces + tables) — which the character-table crack has now proven out.

### M0 — Bench. COMPLETE (2026-07-25). Acceptance status:
- Null-patch output bit-identical to reference: **PASS** (`tests/test_null_build.sh`)
- 60s attract replay deterministic across two runs: **PASS** (`tests/test_attract_determinism.sh`, MAME)
- Headless MAME runner: **DONE** (`tools/run_mame.sh`, MAME 0.288 via Homebrew)
- Headless FBNeo runner: **DONE** (`emu/fbneo` submodule, SDL2 build,
  `tools/run_fbneo.sh` with dummy SDL drivers + sandboxed HOME;
  `tests/test_fbneo_smoke.sh` PASS). The SDL2 frontend has no scripting, so
  the per-frame RAM-checksum probe on the FBNeo side is a frontend patch —
  first M1 task (see below)

Bonus beyond plan: CPS-2 decryption/encryption pipeline
(`tools/cps2_decrypt.py`) proven bit-identical to MAME's implementation via
opcode-space dump oracle (`tests/test_decrypt_oracle.sh`). Both directions
(decrypt for analysis, encrypt for future patch injection) self-check.

## Next actions

1. **FBNeo harness patch (M1 entry):** SDL2 frontend has replay
   (`replay.cpp`) and savestate support but no Lua. Options: (a) small
   frontend patch adding a per-frame work-RAM checksum dump + headless/exit
   flags (frontend, not emulation core — allowed); (b) drive via its .fr
   replay format only. Recommendation: (a); it mirrors the MAME Lua probe.
2. Start M1: three-way program diff (all three sets already decrypt
   bit-identically to the MAME oracle — images in `build/out/`), work-RAM
   map, character-data manifests.

## Open items

- None blocking. Reference collection is COMPLETE: vsav, vsavj, vsav2,
  vhunt2, vhunt2r1, qsound_hle — all MAME `-verifyroms` green, all 76
  members frozen in `docs/checksums.txt` (vsav2 supplied by maintainer
  mid-session 2026-07-25 and folded in; re-freeze recorded here).
- ROM packaging fixes from the 2026-07-25 audit are confirmed applied:
  `vhunt2.key` present in both vhunt2 zips (CRC 61306b20), `qsound_hle.zip`
  present (`dl-1425.bin` CRC d6cf5ef5).

## Decisions made

- **M2 replaced slot = Jedah (slot 0x0F)** — 2026-07-25, maintainer
  approved. Donovan replaces Jedah in vsavj for the proof-of-life
  milestone. Rationale: footprint fit (Jedah 10018 B ≥ Donovan 9358 B),
  boss character (least playtest disruption), keeps Demitri/Victor so the
  M1 replay suite stays valid.
- **CLAUDE.md §4 dual-emulator amendment** — 2026-07-25, maintainer:
  new-content cross-emulator verification is field-level at sync anchors
  (mapped gameplay state), not whole-RAM frame-exact; within-emulator
  oracles stay whole-RAM frame-exact. Text updated in CLAUDE.md §4.
- **Project name = "Vampire Saved"** — 2026-07-25, maintainer.
- **Base revision = `vsavj` (Japan 970519)** — 2026-07-24, maintainer. Closed.
- **Checksum manifest is per-member**, so zip repackaging never matters —
  2026-07-25, session decision (mechanical, no gameplay impact).
- **Raw-image byte-order convention** — 2026-07-25, session decision: ROM
  files are LE-word storage; all derived images are 68k logical (BE) order.
  See docs/GOTCHAS.md first entry.

## Decisions pending (human)

- See SPEC §7 for the rest. None blocks current work.
- **SPEC §2 fact check (community liaison):** "hold Start while selecting
  D/H/P → other game's flavor" did not reproduce in vsav2 under scripted
  test (evidence in docs/atlas/character_tables.md). Since vsav2≡vhunt2
  character data is byte-identical, the variant policy question (§3.3/§3.4)
  may be moot at the data level — worth confirming with the community what
  the Start-hold is believed to do and on which set/revision.

## Open bugs

None.

## Findings log

- 2026-07-25: key masters — vsavj `0xfa8f4e33a4b881b9` (watchdog
  `cmpi.l #$726A4BAF, D0`), vsav2 `0xd681e4f460371edf`, vhunt2
  `0x36c1eba326b10f18` (vsav2/vhunt2 share watchdog
  `cmpi.l #$06920760, D0` — sibling builds). All three: encrypted range
  `PRG:0x000000-0x0FFFFF` only (first 1MB of 4MB). Decryption of all three
  proven bit-identical to MAME (`tests/test_decrypt_oracle.sh <set>`).
- 2026-07-25: ROM file byte order ≠ 68k logical order; cost ~1h; conventions
  locked and oracle-tested (docs/GOTCHAS.md).
- 2026-07-25: MAME 0.288 vsavj boots and runs attract deterministically
  headless (`-video none -sound none`, fresh sandbox per run).

## Integration notes — SMS docs (imported 2026-07-24)

Conventions live in CLAUDE.md §4/§5 now; taxonomy files exist as of this
session. Still to mine when relevant (park, don't re-derive):
- SMS `coltest.lua` pattern (scripted char-select navigation → saved match
  state) for generating the 18×18 matrix states in M4.
- `trace.lua`/`trace_plan.lua` config shape for the CPS-2 input logger.
