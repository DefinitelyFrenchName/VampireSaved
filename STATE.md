# STATE — living progress log

**SPLIT 2026-08-20 (14z-99 post-freeze close, maintainer-approved), AMENDED
2026-09-14 (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17] and [VSP-182]): this file holds the RECENT
session groups and the STANDING SECTIONS; the full detail of every older
session lives verbatim in `STATE_HISTORY.md`, under THE LEDGER at its head.**
How to work with it:
- **Lookup**: "STATE 14z-XX" references resolve here first, then in
  STATE_HISTORY.md (its LEDGER first) — section names are preserved verbatim
  in the archive. A reference to `STATE "Decisions pending"` for an entry no
  longer here resolves in `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` (entries move there verbatim
  when ruled — since 2026-09-14; before that, once they stopped shaping work).
- **A SESSION GROUP'S FORM (since 14z-201, #282 item C; `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — #282 item C"):**
  `## Session KEY — banner`, then `### opened with` and one `### (N) TITLE` section per piece of work, wrapped at
  about 120 characters. Since #288 (2026-10-15) a group has no findings-table section: a finding's fact is homed in its
  document when it is paid for ([VSP-12]). Groups up to 14z-202 keep theirs (`docs/project/findings/<key>.tsv`).
- **Claim-greps MUST include STATE_HISTORY.md** (the CLAUDE.md §5
  retraction-discipline command names it).
- **AN OPEN LIST HOLDS ONLY WHAT IS OPEN (maintainer-ruled 2026-09-14).**
  "Decisions pending" holds undecided items only; nothing closed stays in it,
  however it is marked (struck through, DONE, FIXED, CLOSED). Where each thing
  goes instead:
  - a RULED decision -> its whole entry moves VERBATIM to
    `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` in the commit that records the ruling; while the
    ruling still constrains work, ONE line stating the rule sits under
    "Standing rulings" here, and the line is deleted when it stops;
  - a BUG, COSMETIC ITEM or EVOLUTION is a TICKET — listed in
    `docs/project/tickets.tsv`, its story on its GitHub issue, never listed
    here; a STATE entry for one that closes moves VERBATIM to
    `STATE_HISTORY.md` under the closing session's key (CLAUDE.md [VSP-182]:
    the four questions, the closing comment);
  - "STANDING PRINCIPLE" and "THE DEADNESS REGISTER" carry the [VSP-21..23]
    anchors and stay; the register keeps its withdrawn rows by [VSP-23].
  `tests/test_state_open_lists.sh` enforces it, with the size budget and the
  group count below.
- **THE SESSION CLOSE — ROLLOVER, CHECKLIST, TIER, SWEEP, PROCEDURE CHECK, PUSH — is `docs/project/session_close.md`**
  (#282 item C, ruled 2026-10-15): its step table is the one copy, in order, and `python3 tools/close.py` runs it.
  The rollover rule, the six-step close checklist, the close loop's cost rules and the push rule that stood here
  moved there on 2026-10-15.

## Session 14z-217 — **M24 RELEASED (`freeze/merged-m24` on GitHub from `be40e6f3`, merged-m23's zips pruned) after every release gate GREEN on the Mac, ERIS and PILOT; the proof sheets published at alexrichard.org/vs-proof-sheets/; #127, #162, #294, #338 closed done on rule-checker runs -1566 and -1569; #350 found at the sheets' upload, fixed and gated, closed on run -1572; #351-#354 filed from the release's findings.**

### opened with
The 14z-216 close's opener; `python3 tools/agent/sweep.py` CLEAN; ERIS's release emulator tier still running, as left. The
maintainer: **"read handoff.md, state.md and docs/next_session.md"**, then **"yes"** (the sweep and ERIS's tier), then
**"yes and you can also go through all the release process unless at some point you need my input"**. Working evidence:
`build/agent217/` (local); the release's evidence file `build/agent217/release/closures_evidence.txt`.

### (1) THE M24 RELEASE, ON THE FREEZE COMMIT `be40e6f3`
- **ERIS's release emulator tier** (started 14z-216, `--controls --jobs 6`, no reuse): ended 2026-11-02 01:05 UTC, PASS 441,
  SKIP 4 (`test_readme_recording`, `test_release_binaries`, `audit_release_linux_desktop`, `audit_release_linux_cleanhost`:
  host-bound), FAIL 0, 248 control rows; copied to the Mac as `build/emu_rel216_eris` (tarball sha256 equal both ends).
- **The Mac's host rows**, each on a snapshot of `be40e6f3` with `--controls`: `test_mame_parity` (1 control),
  `test_release_binaries` (4), `test_readme_recording` (5), and the MiSTer lane at `--jobs 4` (8 gates, 4 controls, 4 h 10
  min): all GREEN (`build/emu_rel217_mac_*`, `build/emu_rel217_mister`).
- **PILOT** at `be40e6f3`: `audit_release_linux_cleanhost` GREEN (2 controls). `audit_release_linux_desktop` needed the
  maintainer's session unlocked (**"it is now unlocked."**); run under `gnome-session-inhibit`. Its first run went red on
  FBNeo alone: every capture showed PAUSE from 9 s, before any key (FBNeo pauses on focus loss,
  `emu/fbneo/src/burner/sdl/run.cpp:456`); the cause of the focus loss is NOT measured (no window-manager package changed on
  PILOT since 2026-09-14; #352). A re-run into the SAME `--log` directory appended to the red run's `results.tsv` and read
  NOT GREEN (#353: the 14z-213 gotcha "a fresh run pointed at an old `--log` directory", paid again); the run of record is a fresh directory, `build/emu_p217_desk2`: GREEN, 3 controls. After rule-checker run
  -1561, PILOT also ran the Linux binaries' `test_release_binaries` and `test_readme_recording` with controls: both GREEN.
- **The Windows half of `test_release_launcher_bat`** on ERIS at `be40e6f3`: PASS, 8 controls fired, `first-found` FAILs as
  a mode (`build/agent217/release/bat217*.log`).
- **The static release tier of record** (snapshot of `be40e6f3`, `--reuse` of the freeze run S5 on the same tree
  `9a1fe8b8`): PASS 236, SKIP 1 (that launcher's Windows half), FAIL 0
  (`build/agent217/release/static_rel_record.tsv`). The maintainer, asked: **"Accept (Recommended)"**.
- **Published** on the maintainer's **"Publish now (Recommended)"**: `tools/upload_release_assets.sh freeze/merged-m24
  --prune` created the release, uploaded and re-verified 9 assets, pruned merged-m23's 9 zips; the 15 `BINARY.txt`
  asset lines moved to merged-m24 (in this close's commit).
- **The published zips are the commit's release**, measured after rule-checker runs -1561..-1563: all 308 files of the 9
  zips downloaded back equal `be40e6f3`'s (tracked files byte for byte, binaries by their `BINARY.txt` rows); every one of
  the 9 packages applied to the dumps builds merged-m24 `43505a12`, one set (sha256 `01e9445b`), whose 25 members equal
  `build/m3b_merged32`, the build the gates judged; each comparator with must-fail controls
  (`build/agent217/release/close/`).
- **The proof sheets**: local run of `be40e6f3` (58 gates, exit 0, a clean checkout) drawn with `web` (102 pages, 23,174
  tiles, 152 clips; webcheck PASS). `--host pilot` could not run a gate whose control build is a freeze tag (#351).
  `tools/publish_sheets.sh` hung at the ssh password prompt (#350, item 3); the maintainer uploaded by hand (**"manual
  upload done successfully"**, **"https://alexrichard.org/vs-proof-sheets/"**); the site checked by
  `build/agent217/release/close/served_check.sh`: 285 files (every page, every clip, 30 pictures) equal, 3 controls fired.

### (2) THE RELEASE'S CLOSURES: #127, #162, #294, #338
Each through the rule-checker before closing (no action held for the close). #127, #162 and #294: runs -1561 to -1566,
every VIOLATED round a real gap resolved by work (the zips tied to the commit; the Linux binaries' gates; all 9 packages
applied; the comparators' controls; each gate's NOT COVERED items and frozen-blind census parts in the comments; #354,
no gate on what reaches #294's dead span in the built image, named), -1566 OK; closed with their comments. #338: runs
-1567 to -1569 (the site check's fetch path and controls, the run's whole provenance, every clip compared), -1569 OK;
closed. `docs/game/engine_internals.md` still said (M) "is not built" and the census had one differing site: both marked
superseded (every site SAME at the release). `docs/project/tickets.tsv` rows updated.

### (3) #350 — `publish_sheets.sh` HUNG AT THE SSH PASSWORD PROMPT
GNU `timeout` without `--foreground` takes the terminal from rsync/ssh (measured under a pty: `build/agent217/t350/repro.txt`).
Fixed with `timeout --foreground`; `tests/test_proof_sheets_web.sh` section 2b drives the publisher under a pseudo-terminal
with a stub rsync that prompts on `/dev/tty`: the answer reaches it and Ctrl+C ends it within 5 s; the new control
`no-foreground` loses the answer and survives Ctrl+C (both of the maintainer's symptoms). The control's first version fired
without reaching the upload and was fixed before it was trusted. Rule-checker runs -1570, -1571 (Ctrl+C untested), -1572 OK;
closed. Gotcha: `docs/platform/gotchas.md` (GNU `timeout` WITHOUT `--foreground`).

### (4) TICKETS FILED: #350-#354
#350 (item 3); #351 (`proof_sheets run --host` and freeze-tag control builds); #352 (the desktop gate's paused-FBNeo verdict);
#353 (`run_all_emulator.sh --log` appends to an existing directory); #354 (no gate on #294's dead span in the built image).

### CLOSE (14z-217, 2026-11-02)
Driver `build/agent217/close/` (`--prev build/agent216/close/tier_results.tsv`, the 14z-216 close's run of record). Steps:
sections (this group; a pointer on 14z-216 (1b)); next-session (the 14z-216 opener moved VERBATIM to the top of
`docs/NEXT_SESSION_HISTORY.md`, checked by un-quoting it; `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` rewritten: #310 first); rollover (the
14z-216 group, 172 lines, to `STATE_HISTORY.md` with its ledger line; every committed line of it found in the archive; no
`STATE.md §` citation pointed into it); indexes (regenerated by the driver); dashboard (14z-163..14z-217, 3,356 figures, 0
unclassed; five assets uploaded, `datasets` re-pointed: actions v6, costly v26, figures v26, rc_runs v26, tiers v27) — done.
The records also carry the 14z-216 close's after-push lines and its opener note, uncommitted until now as they said. The
tier's results: `build/agent217/close/tier_results.tsv`, the next close's `--prev`.

# STANDING SECTIONS (current state — never archived)
## Standing rulings


One line per ruling that still constrains work: the rule and where its full entry lives. A line is deleted when its ruling stops constraining work (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17]). Shortened to the rule plus its pointer 2026-10-14 (#282 item A); the longer lines are in git history at `44a09f7f`.

- **#345's rows may turn DIFF under a non-zero RNG; the parity gates keep the 0000 pin (2026-11-01, 14z-216):** `tools/rng_forms.py` exempts rows `after:` a SLOWDOWN root, by name — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-01 (14z-216) — #345's rows under a non-zero RNG".
- **A new zero-pass frame native vs2 has too is accepted, frame by frame (2026-11-01, 14z-216, #294):** `audit_lag_budget`'s ACCEPTED list (today donovan_2:3094, vs2's 3098, checked against `pass_overrun.tsv`'s native row), re-confirmed on the captures as *"a tradeoff. #345 is there to fix it later"*; the no-new-lag rule stands for every other frame — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-01 (14z-216) — #294's lag frame" and "…re-confirmed on the captures".
- **ERIS tiers skip parity; the Mac's parity run is the row of record (#321, 2026-10-26, 14z-209):** ERIS runs `--skip test_mame_parity` — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-26 (14z-209) — #321 phase 2".
- **ROM content in the tree (2026-10-18, 14z-205):** addresses and discrete values are fine; a whole graphic or sound, or a whole algorithm, is not ([VSP-8]; the four quoted sound-driver bytes stay) — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-18 (14z-205) — the no-ROM-bytes rule: …".
- **#291's last 22 gates (2026-10-18, 14z-205):** the tap gates prove by an EVENT-PROVEN basis (D2), groups 3-5 take a `no-picture` declaration kind (D4), D4 first — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-18 (14z-205) — #291 S2: …".
- **An action is checked when its work is done, never held for the close (2026-10-16, 14z-203):** a ticket is closed and a recommendation put in the piece of work that finishes it, through its rule-checker run then; a run cited in a CLOSE section is the tell — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-16 (14z-203) — an action is checked when its work is done, never held for the close".
- **The close's cost must follow the change; #286, #287, #288 are the direct priority (2026-10-15, 14z-202):** controls only on a real change, the procedure check right after each piece of work, the audit layer measured before it is cut — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-202) — the close's cost must follow the change".
- **Cross-platform checks run on demand or at release (#285, 2026-10-15, 14z-201b):** `test_release_launcher_bat`'s Windows half is a NOTE off Windows below release cadence, so a session close needs no ERIS — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201b) — #285".
- **The recording procedure lives in the release package README (#284, 2026-10-15, 14z-201):** the root README's "Report a problem" was trimmed by the maintainer (2026-10-15); #284's work moves `test_readme_recording` to the generated MAME package README — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — the recording procedure moves to the release package README".
- **The live documents' budget (#282, 2026-10-14/15, 14z-201):** CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, HANDOFF.md and docs/NEXT_SESSION.md at most 500 lines and 50,000 bytes each, the aim 200 lines; the archives are indexed, not budgeted — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-14 (14z-201) — #282's scope" and "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — #282 item F"; gate `tests/test_live_budget.sh`.
- **No swarm model at max effort, ever (2026-09-29, 14z-185);** the Sonnet 5.5 `xhigh` worker preference was dropped (14z-192) — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` 2026-09-29 and "Ruled 2026-10-05 (14z-192) — the opener's answers".
- **The parity gates' per-frame level and RNG pins are their equalised input (2026-09-25, 14z-182):** they may write `RAM:$FF8116` and `RAM:$FF80D4` every frame on both legs; the rule-checker's Q3 reads that as a ruled premise — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-182) — the parity gates' per-frame level and RNG pins".
- **The opener's sweep survivor is killed before the push only on the maintainer's command (2026-09-25, 14z-182):** the close puts the no-adverse-effect evidence to the maintainer and waits — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-182) — the opener's sweep survivor".
- **The orchestrator is Opus 5.5 at effort High (2026-09-25);** a sitting on another model says so at the opener — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (after the 14z-181 close) — the orchestrator".
- **A /btw fork is exempt from the worker cap (2026-09-25, 14z-181);** the close names the fork — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — the worker cap".
- **The nine 14z-181 capture reads are all IDENTICAL (2026-09-25):** Victor's one-frame throw difference is documented and validated; #175's next step is the vs2 check — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — the maintainer's reads".
- **#172, the agent architecture (2026-09-23 to 09-24):** a block binds the task at fault, never the session; deterministic hooks hard-block and the model checker blocks until resolved in writing; the checker reads a generic checklist, never CLAUDE.md, at every push and close; workers are capped on the call; the rule-checker is a pinned definition; the orchestrator is a plain session, and the `--cap` read is a step of every close — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-175) — #172" through "Ruled 2026-09-24 (14z-179)".
- **#171 Q6, the 73 poke read-back findings, are ruled as proposed (2026-09-25, 14z-181)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — #171 Q6".
- **#171 is closed; gate gaps are caught as they surface, each its own ticket, and a review handed to the maintainer carries its references and context (2026-10-01, 14z-187b)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-01 (14z-187b) — #171 closed `done`".
- **FBNeo patch 0003 (drop SDL2_image) is RATIFIED for RELEASE builds (2026-09-21, 14z-173):** applied by `build_release_emulators.sh`, not by `setup_fbneo.sh` — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ratified 2026-09-21 (14z-173) — FBNeo patch 0003".
- **#144: macOS blocks the binaries and right-click > Open does not get past it (2026-09-20, 14z-173);** clearing the quarantine flag works (`PLAY.command` offers it); the player READMEs are written for a non-developer; the applier page ships as a local file, one per release — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — #144 is macOS BLOCKING the binaries".
- **The applied set is DEFLATED and the QSound BIOS member is OPTIONAL (`--no-qsound-bios`) (2026-09-20, 14z-173)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — the applied set is DEFLATED".
- **The deliverables' order, macOS first (2026-09-20, 14z-173):** standalone set, launcher per platform, #144/#145 on clean hosts, README pass, the applier app; macOS and MiSTer are the proof of concept — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — THE DELIVERABLES".
- **The standalone set lands in the RELEASE, not the build (2026-09-20, 14z-173)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — the standalone set lands in the RELEASE".
- **The disabled EX route does the no-stock move (2026-09-18, refined 2026-09-19):** the tenants' vs2 EX input is read as its sub-pattern at every stock level; Pyron's 623+PP is the ES move with a stock and the normal move without — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-169) — the disabled EX route does the NO-STOCK move" and "Ruled 2026-09-19 (14z-170) — Pyron's 2623+PP with stock reads NATURALLY".
- **The 0x52 fix is scoped S1 (2026-09-18, 14z-169):** Phobos's two trap remaps stay on the solo track only — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-169) — the class-0x52 fix is scoped".
- **#136: all the analysis first, then the fixes, then relentless regression testing (2026-09-18, 14z-168)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168) — #136: ALL the analysis first".
- **The tenants' Dark Force (2026-09-18, 14z-168):** vsav's Dark Force change with the shells' common rules, each tenant's vs2 startup window and personal Dark Force; compared against the vs2 EX move; the duration stays vsavj's (360/377/360); the tenants' vs2 EX input into the mode on our build is to be disabled — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168)".
- **The tenants' defense rows become vs2's (2026-09-18, 14z-168)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168) — the tenants' DEFENSE rows become vs2's".
- **The column shock and the Plasma Trap take vs2's class-0x52 rule (2026-09-18, 14z-168)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168) — the column shock and the Plasma Trap".
- **No gauge is built during Dark Force (2026-09-18, 14z-168)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168) — no gauge is built during Dark Force".
- **The close checklist, six steps (2026-09-18, 14z-167b)** — the steps live in `docs/project/session_close.md` (since 2026-10-15, #282 item C); `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-167b)".
- **#136 goes over again by the 14z-164 census (2026-09-17):** per-event verdicts with stock, meter fraction and P2's HP, every "in DF" event asserted in DF, a same-data P2, the 13 rows re-labelled — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-17 (14z-164)".
- **The rule-checker's Q3 and Q4 are BOUNDED, and a VIOLATED is resolved question by question in writing (2026-09-17, 14z-163)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-17 (14z-163) — the rule-checker's questions".
- **#136 is gone over again IN FULL, not only through its faithfulness control (2026-09-16)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-16 (14z-160)".
- **The static tier is turned around, C1-C4 adopted (2026-10-12, 14z-199):** a session close runs the changed gates plus a core (built as #269: `--strict --confirm`), a freeze and a release run everything — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-12 (14z-199) — where session time goes and why rule-checker runs fail: …".
- **The order of work (2026-09-17):** a stable state first, then #148, then #152, then everything else — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-17 (14z-161b)".
- **Release scope (2026-09-02):** every test whose subject is the released artifact runs at release; anything red or skipped is a hard fail unless approved at release time — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Moved 2026-09-14 (14z-154)".
- **A red gate is a question (2026-09-02):** first establish which side's expectation rests on a measurement — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Moved 2026-09-14 (14z-154)".
- **Cross-game comparisons at a matched speed level and a pinned RNG (2026-09-15, #135, #142)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-15 (14z-158)" and "Moved 2026-09-14 (14z-154)".
- **No static substituted-wheel gate (2026-09-02);** the defence is [VSP-163] — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Moved 2026-09-14 (14z-154)".
- **Oboro's intro stays (2026-08-28):** never delay round start or cut the intro for a cosmetic reason — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Moved 2026-09-14 (14z-154)".

## STANDING PRINCIPLE (maintainer, 2026-08-05): vanilla wins ties

**[VSP-21]** "vsav vanilla is always better when we can." **When a console port and
arcade vsav differ and both would work, take vanilla.** A console port's
choice is not evidence that vanilla is wrong; it is evidence of what that
port's designers preferred.

This is a general rule, not a one-off: the PS1 capture is a reference for
what is POSSIBLE and for data we cannot otherwise obtain (cell placement,
the adjacency of NEW cells), not a style guide for content vsav already
defines. Paired with the maintainer's other statement — "as long as we can
select characters it's good" — the test is: does keeping vanilla still let
the feature work? If yes, keep vanilla.

Applied immediately, twice:
- **`Bishamon DL` and `Aulbath DR` stay vanilla** (Anakaris / Sasquatch).
  PS1 sets both to "no move"; neither is needed for reachability, so
  vanilla stands.
- **Horizontal wrap stays vanilla.** Vsav wraps left/right (cell `0x01`
  Left goes to `0x05`, measured and confirmed in-emulator); the PS1 report
  of "no wrapping" reflects untested extremes. We touch none of those
  cells, so nothing to decide.

Judgment applied under the same rule, open to veto: the three inbound edges
from `0x0B` (`D`/`DL`/`DR` into the new row) DO diverge from vanilla, and
strictly they are not required — Phobos and Donovan are already reachable
via `Bishamon D` and `Aulbath D`, and Pyron through them. They are kept
because without them, pressing Down on the cell directly above the new row
does nothing while three medallions are visible below it, which is the UX
failure "as long as we can select characters" is meant to exclude. Dropping
them would reduce the legacy footprint from 5 bytes to 2.

## Decisions pending (human)

Only undecided items live here; a ruling moves its entry to `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` in the
commit that records it (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17]).

## THE DEADNESS REGISTER (opened 14z-71, maintainer's standing instruction)

**[VSP-23]** Every claim of the form **"legacy never reaches this, so we may reuse
it"**. Each is measured by ABSENCE, which is the weakest kind of evidence
we accept, so each is listed here with its guard. **These are the FIRST
PLACES TO CHECK for any unexplained regression in vanilla assets, engine
behaviour or rendering** — before anything else is suspected.

| Reused resource | Claim | Guard | Fallback if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~palette-seq ids 0x1E-0x21 (`0x39ACC0`)~~ **CLAIM FALSE, ROW WITHDRAWN 14z-79 (they are Bulleta's DF block)** | vanilla only ever requests 0x26/0x27 | `tests/audit_palette_seq_ids.sh` (10,504 sampled calls) | none — the palette path never transits work RAM, so the audit is the ONLY guard |
| effect-class row 16 (`0x080AEC`) | vanilla never dispatches class 16 | `tests/audit_effect_class_rows.sh` §1, 0 reads over every frame of six replays vs a 3,872-hit control (14z-197; 1,760 on the old clock's part-replays) | none needed: the row was a stub (`rts`), so a wrong claim costs at most the old no-op |
| ~~drawer list-type 6 (`0x01B6AA`)~~ **CLAIM FALSE (measured 14z-89) — LEGACY LISTS DO REACH TYPE 6** | vanilla has no type-6 sprite lists | `audit_effect_class_rows.sh` §1/§4 + `tests/test_beam_list_type6.sh` | **THE FALLBACK HELD — this is what a safe-and-loud design buys.** 14z-89 measured the tripwire ARMED on legacy content on huitzil-m13: `21_don_mash` 387 times and `26_don_arcade_mash` 948 times, PC-attributed to inside the thunk body (0x0FD060). Rendering stayed correct throughout (the fallback runs vsav's own type-6 code, reproduced instruction-for-instruction), so nothing rendered wrong and no playtest ever saw it — exactly the outcome the register's "prefer designs where being wrong is safe and loud" rule was written for. WHY IT WAS MISSED: the deadness measurement was sound but its COVERAGE was four replays (`02/07/09/30`), and the gate has always run on that default set; the two replays that arm it are long mash/arcade rigs nobody pointed it at. COST TODAY: `$FF010C/$FF010D` is a live work-RAM counter vanilla does not keep, so both replays diverge permanently from the vanilla masked basis — they are `.pending` on huitzil-m13 pending the maintainer's ruling. ~~OPEN: does the fallback need to stop counting (make the tripwire diagnostic-only / move it out of work RAM), or is the counter acceptable? See "Decisions pending — 14z-89"~~ **ANSWERED 14z-91: the counter was REMOVED** — the `beam_list_type6` `RAM:$FF010C` counter deleted, which cleared all six `.pending` legacy replays (`HANDOFF.md` Build registry, the 14z-91 row (C)) |

**[VSP-22]** Rules for adding a row: the claim must be measured with a POSITIVE CONTROL
on the same instrument and leg (a blind instrument and a real zero look
identical — paid for three times in 14z-71); it must name its guard; and
it must say what happens if the claim is wrong. Prefer designs where being
wrong is *safe and loud* over designs that are merely well-measured.
