# STATE — living progress log

**SPLIT 2026-08-20 (14z-99 post-freeze close, maintainer-approved), AMENDED
2026-09-14 (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17] and [VSP-182]): this file holds the RECENT
session groups and the STANDING SECTIONS; the full detail of every older
session lives verbatim in `STATE_HISTORY.md`, under THE LEDGER at its head.**
How to work with it:
- **Lookup**: "STATE 14z-XX" references resolve here first, then in
  STATE_HISTORY.md (its LEDGER first) — section names are preserved verbatim
  in the archive. A reference to `STATE "Decisions pending"` for an entry no
  longer here resolves in `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` (entries move there verbatim
  when ruled — since 2026-09-14; before that, once they stopped shaping work).
- **A SESSION GROUP'S FORM (since 14z-201, #282 item C; `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — #282 item C"):**
  `## Session KEY — banner`, then `### opened with` and one `### (N) TITLE` section per piece of work, wrapped at
  about 120 characters. Since #288 (2026-10-15) a group has no findings-table section: a finding's fact is homed in its
  document when it is paid for ([VSP-12]). Groups up to 14z-202 keep theirs (`docs/project/findings/<key>.tsv`).
- **Claim-greps MUST include STATE_HISTORY.md** (the CLAUDE.md §5
  retraction-discipline command names it).
- **AN OPEN LIST HOLDS ONLY WHAT IS OPEN (maintainer-ruled 2026-09-14).**
  "Decisions pending" holds undecided items only; nothing closed stays in it,
  however it is marked (struck through, DONE, FIXED, CLOSED). Where each thing
  goes instead:
  - a RULED decision -> its whole entry moves VERBATIM to
    `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` in the commit that records the ruling; while the
    ruling still constrains work, ONE line stating the rule sits under
    "Standing rulings" here, and the line is deleted when it stops;
  - a BUG, COSMETIC ITEM or EVOLUTION is a TICKET — listed in
    `docs/project/tickets.tsv`, its story on its GitHub issue, never listed
    here; a STATE entry for one that closes moves VERBATIM to
    `STATE_HISTORY.md` under the closing session's key (CLAUDE.md [VSP-182]:
    the four questions, the closing comment);
  - "STANDING PRINCIPLE" and "THE DEADNESS REGISTER" carry the [VSP-21..23]
    anchors and stay; the register keeps its withdrawn rows by [VSP-23].
  `tests/test_state_open_lists.sh` enforces it, with the size budget and the
  group count below.
- **THE SESSION CLOSE — ROLLOVER, CHECKLIST, TIER, SWEEP, PROCEDURE CHECK, PUSH — is `docs/project/session_close.md`**
  (#282 item C, ruled 2026-10-15): its step table is the one copy, in order, and `python3 tools/close.py` runs it.
  The rollover rule, the six-step close checklist, the close loop's cost rules and the push rule that stood here
  moved there on 2026-10-15.

## Session 14z-219 — **#356 built (Donovan's dash speed lines: a tenant-only copy of vs2's effect, type 124) and #345 option A1b built (his trail pieces read a WIDE-only copy of vs2's blanked effect anim table; the ice streak #346 gone), both on scratch builds, their timing and looks ruled, the M25 freeze put to the next session; #357 and #358 captured and read; #360 filed; two generator facilities (`[[ref_pin]]`, the extractor's `:dp`) and two gates.**

### opened with
The 14z-218 close's opener; `python3 tools/agent/sweep.py` CLEAN; `main` = `origin/main` at `79a376ef`. The maintainer:
**"read handoff.md, state.md and docs/next_session.md"**, then, told only the Mac was available, agreed to **"start on #356
now and take it as far as the freeze. Meanwhile, run #345's census and the #357/#358 captures. -> agreed"**. PILOT came back
late in the sitting (*"Btw pilot is accessible"*), ERIS was powering up. Working evidence: `build/agent219/` (local).

### (1) #356 — BUILT (not frozen)
As ruled (Option 1, the raw allocator): vs2's speed-line handler, its two 14-row tables and its spawner (`PRG:0x06E1D2`, one
span 0x2FE, vhunt2 twin `0x06E346`) as a WIDE-only extraction root, placed in `wide_ext` and reached as Donovan's own effect
type 124 (`[[obj_hook_extra]]`, its first shipped use, now gated by its owner's slot track); two `port_patch` rows (the
stamp, vsavj's bank word), two new `[[ref_pin]]` rows (vsavj's anim table `0x283690`; the raw allocator `0x016FBA`), a recon
row in Donovan's overlay; patch_notes 14z-219. Found on the way: the allocator's gap-fit ignored an assigned space and moved
100 later ops (fixed: `region_space` regions skip gap-fit; `docs/project/gotchas.md`). `build/m5_wide/extract` regenerated
for the root (one new region; two call sites re-classed; reverted at the close, the rows staged: see CLOSE). Scratch merged `build/agent219/t356/mg1` `fd98f45c`; stock twin
`a3910ded` and Phobos/Pyron solo programs UNCHANGED. Measured: 24 of 24 spawn groups and 1,114 of 1,114 piece records equal
native vs2 outside Dark Force; inside it (`donovan_6`) two pieces one frame out of phase (#360); the 16 legacy dash cells
identical to vsavj; `audit_merged_legacy` PASS; `audit_lag_budget` PASS. New gate `tests/audit_don_speed_lines.sh` (tap
`tests/lua/speed_line_tap.lua`, legacy rig `tests/replays/don/356_legacy_lilith_dash.rpl`; a dash group is judged only while
the match agrees). The maintainer on the before/after sheets: **"Yes, they match"**; on the Dark Force phase: **"Accept,
ticket it (Recommended)"** (`DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-03 (14z-219) — #356"). Comment posted on #356.

### (2) #345 — THE CLASS-0x72 CENSUS, A1b RULED, BUILT, ITS TIMING RULED
The census (a worker, `build/agent219/t345/CENSUS.md`, local): vsavj has no class 0x72 (0 stamps in seven forms, control 7;
0 slot-frames on 84 legacy rigs on vsavj and merged-m24); what the trail pieces share with legacy is DATA, the effect anim
table vsavj `PRG:0x1F3FD2` / vs2 `PRG:0x1D7428`, which vs2 BLANKED (every node a no-draw record) and Sasquatch reads live on
vsavj (`docs/game/engine_internals.md`, #346's section). Rule-checker `2026-11-03-1589` VIOLATED (Q1, fixed), `-1590` OK; the
maintainer: **"A1b (Recommended)"**. Built: the table as a WIDE-only DATA root — `:d` classed none of its pointers (vhunt2's
nodes point elsewhere; gotcha), so a new extractor form `:dp` (self-pointers only; 403 of 403 offsets equal vsavj's twin);
two `[[ref_pin]]` rows keep Donovan's unreached operands on vsavj's table. Scratch merged `build/agent219/t345a/mg` `a24aa560`
(with #356). Measured: every trail piece format 10 through the copy; the streak gone on the sheets; legacy PASS; draw cost
per piece native 390, merged-m24 848, A1b 532 cycles. New gate `tests/audit_don_trail_nodraw.sh` (tap
`tests/lua/class72_tap.lua`). **The timing:** ours has no zero-pass frame in Blizzard Sword where native has f3098/f4580; on
screen one held picture remains a frame earlier and ours runs one frame ahead, donovan_2's parity events 3-25 turn DIFF;
`pass_overrun`, `audit_lag_budget` (its ACCEPTED 3094 now stale), `move_parity`, `rng_forms` red on the build until
re-frozen. The recommendation (`build/agent219/t345/rec/REC_lostframes.md`) went through runs `-1591` to `-1597`, each
VIOLATED on a real overclaim and fixed (the on-screen counts form A only, then all three forms; the 24th row; the
attribution to A1b, settled by `audit_move_parity` on the #356-only build), `-1598` OK; an order slip recorded in `-1595`'s
resolve. The maintainer: **"Accept, freeze A1b (Recommended)"** (`DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-03 (14z-219) — #345:
the built A1b's timing is accepted"). Comments posted on #345.

### (3) #357, #358 — CAPTURED AND READ; #360 FILED
A worker's sheets (`build/agent219/t357/sheets/`, local), sent: #357 is eight red class-0x72 orbs at Donovan's GUARD that ours
lacks (the issue's "Ifrit Sword" wording superseded; title edited), #358 the small figure at Phobos's lower left placed ~50 px
left and posed differently on ours. The maintainer: **"Yes, the guard orbs"**, **"Yes, that figure"**. #360 filed (#356's Dark
Force phase). Comments posted on #357 and #358.

### CLOSE (14z-219, 2026-11-03)
Driver `build/agent219/close/` (`--prev build/agent218/close/tier_results.tsv`, the 14z-218 close's run of record; `--row -`).
The freeze (M25: #356 + A1b) goes to the next session (the maintainer: *"Eris is powering up but let's close and freeze next
session"*). Riding this close and uncommitted until now: the 14z-218 close's post-commit lines in STATE/NEXT_SESSION; (1)-(3)'s tree
changes, the build-changing ones as the staged patch. The tier's results:
`build/agent219/close/tier_results.tsv`, the next close's `--prev`.
Steps: sections (this group, (1)-(3) and this section); next-session (the 14z-218 opener moved VERBATIM to the top of
`docs/NEXT_SESSION_HISTORY.md`, checked by un-quoting it; `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` rewritten: the M25 freeze first); rollover
(the 14z-218 group, 96 lines, to `STATE_HISTORY.md` with its ledger line; every line found in the archive; no `STATE`
citation into it); indexes (regenerated by the driver); dashboard (14z-163..14z-219, 3,454 figures, 0 unclassed; five assets
uploaded, `datasets` re-pointed: actions v8, costly v28, figures v28, rc_runs v28, tiers v29). On GitHub before the close:
#360 filed; comments on #345 (twice), #356, #357 (its title corrected), #358. A slip at the rollover, found by `test_state_open_lists` before
the tier: the 14z-218 group went in at the first "## Session 14z-217" string, a line of STATE_HISTORY's generated INDEX, and
the indexes step regenerated it away; restored from HEAD's STATE.md plus its five post-commit lines, below the INDEX (94
lines, none missing after a second index regeneration).
Tier 1 (staged tree `727def25`): NOT GREEN, PASS 132 FAIL 8 — the tree no longer reproduced the frozen M24 builds
(`test_m3a_reproducible`, `test_freeze_artifacts_current`) and the counts the change moves (`test_manifest_merge`,
`test_rule5_census`, `test_region_overlap` and its control, `test_charmap_current`), plus `test_recurrence_alarm` on
#345's hold figures recurring across runs `-1580`, `-1592`..`-1596` (acknowledged under #345 in
`tests/rulecheck/recurrence.tsv`). Fix, by the 14z-188 precedent: the build-changing rows staged as
`build/manifest/staged/356_345a1b.patch` and reverted to HEAD (the pinned extract and `build/merged1` too); the seven reds
then PASS on the main tree, `test_m3a_reproducible` rebuilding every frozen reference bit-exactly with the committed
generator and extractor facilities, which are therefore inert; what the freeze re-freezes with the patch applied is in
patch_notes 14z-219. Tier 2 on the red run's results (#317).

# STANDING SECTIONS (current state — never archived)
## Standing rulings


One line per ruling that still constrains work: the rule and where its full entry lives. A line is deleted when its ruling stops constraining work (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17]). Shortened to the rule plus its pointer 2026-10-14 (#282 item A); the longer lines are in git history at `44a09f7f`.

- **#356 is built as Option 1 (a tenant-only copy of the speed-line effect with vs2's 14-row tables), with the raw allocator, and frozen as M25 as built; its one-frame Dark Force phase is accepted and is #360 (2026-11-02 and 2026-11-03, 14z-218/219)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-02 (14z-218) — #356" and "Ruled 2026-11-03 (14z-219) — #356".
- **#345's option A1b is built and its timing ACCEPTED: it freezes in M25 with #356 — ours loses no logic frame in Blizzard Sword where native does; the moved expectations (pass_overrun, the stale lag exemption, donovan_2's parity and RNG-form rows) re-freeze at the freeze, each through its own rule-checker run; vsavj's table PRG:0x1F3FD2 is never touched; B stays held (2026-11-02 and 2026-11-03, 14z-218/219)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-02 (14z-218) — #345", "Ruled 2026-11-03 (14z-219) — #345: option A is built as A1b" and "… the built A1b's timing is accepted".
- **#345's rows may turn DIFF under a non-zero RNG; the parity gates keep the 0000 pin (2026-11-01, 14z-216):** `tools/rng_forms.py` exempts rows `after:` a SLOWDOWN root, by name — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-01 (14z-216) — #345's rows under a non-zero RNG".
- **A new zero-pass frame native vs2 has too is accepted, frame by frame (2026-11-01, 14z-216, #294):** `audit_lag_budget`'s ACCEPTED list (today donovan_2:3094, vs2's 3098, checked against `pass_overrun.tsv`'s native row), re-confirmed on the captures as *"a tradeoff. #345 is there to fix it later"*; the no-new-lag rule stands for every other frame — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-11-01 (14z-216) — #294's lag frame" and "…re-confirmed on the captures".
- **ERIS tiers skip parity; the Mac's parity run is the row of record (#321, 2026-10-26, 14z-209):** ERIS runs `--skip test_mame_parity` — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-26 (14z-209) — #321 phase 2".
- **ROM content in the tree (2026-10-18, 14z-205):** addresses and discrete values are fine; a whole graphic or sound, or a whole algorithm, is not ([VSP-8]; the four quoted sound-driver bytes stay) — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-18 (14z-205) — the no-ROM-bytes rule: …".
- **#291's last 22 gates (2026-10-18, 14z-205):** the tap gates prove by an EVENT-PROVEN basis (D2), groups 3-5 take a `no-picture` declaration kind (D4), D4 first — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-18 (14z-205) — #291 S2: …".
- **An action is checked when its work is done, never held for the close (2026-10-16, 14z-203):** a ticket is closed and a recommendation put in the piece of work that finishes it, through its rule-checker run then; a run cited in a CLOSE section is the tell — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-16 (14z-203) — an action is checked when its work is done, never held for the close".
- **The close's cost must follow the change; #286, #287, #288 are the direct priority (2026-10-15, 14z-202):** controls only on a real change, the procedure check right after each piece of work, the audit layer measured before it is cut — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-202) — the close's cost must follow the change".
- **Cross-platform checks run on demand or at release (#285, 2026-10-15, 14z-201b):** `test_release_launcher_bat`'s Windows half is a NOTE off Windows below release cadence, so a session close needs no ERIS — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201b) — #285".
- **The recording procedure lives in the release package README (#284, 2026-10-15, 14z-201):** the root README's "Report a problem" was trimmed by the maintainer (2026-10-15); #284's work moves `test_readme_recording` to the generated MAME package README — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — the recording procedure moves to the release package README".
- **The live documents' budget (#282, 2026-10-14/15, 14z-201):** CLAUDE.md, STATE.md, HANDOFF.md and docs/NEXT_SESSION.md at most 500 lines and 50,000 bytes each, the aim 200 lines; the archives are indexed, not budgeted — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-14 (14z-201) — #282's scope" and "Ruled 2026-10-15 (14z-201) — #282 item F"; gate `tests/test_live_budget.sh`.
- **No swarm model at max effort, ever (2026-09-29, 14z-185);** the Sonnet 5.5 `xhigh` worker preference was dropped (14z-192) — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` 2026-09-29 and "Ruled 2026-10-05 (14z-192) — the opener's answers".
- **The parity gates' per-frame level and RNG pins are their equalised input (2026-09-25, 14z-182):** they may write `RAM:$FF8116` and `RAM:$FF80D4` every frame on both legs; the rule-checker's Q3 reads that as a ruled premise — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-182) — the parity gates' per-frame level and RNG pins".
- **The opener's sweep survivor is killed before the push only on the maintainer's command (2026-09-25, 14z-182):** the close puts the no-adverse-effect evidence to the maintainer and waits — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-182) — the opener's sweep survivor".
- **The orchestrator is Opus 5.5 at effort High (2026-09-25);** a sitting on another model says so at the opener — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (after the 14z-181 close) — the orchestrator".
- **A /btw fork is exempt from the worker cap (2026-09-25, 14z-181);** the close names the fork — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — the worker cap".
- **The nine 14z-181 capture reads are all IDENTICAL (2026-09-25):** Victor's one-frame throw difference is documented and validated; #175's next step is the vs2 check — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — the maintainer's reads".
- **#172, the agent architecture (2026-09-23 to 09-24):** a block binds the task at fault, never the session; deterministic hooks hard-block and the model checker blocks until resolved in writing; the checker reads a generic checklist, never CLAUDE.md, at every push and close; workers are capped on the call; the rule-checker is a pinned definition; the orchestrator is a plain session, and the `--cap` read is a step of every close — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-23 (14z-175) — #172" through "Ruled 2026-09-24 (14z-179)".
- **#171 Q6, the 73 poke read-back findings, are ruled as proposed (2026-09-25, 14z-181)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-25 (14z-181) — #171 Q6".
- **#171 is closed; gate gaps are caught as they surface, each its own ticket, and a review handed to the maintainer carries its references and context (2026-10-01, 14z-187b)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-10-01 (14z-187b) — #171 closed `done`".
- **FBNeo patch 0003 (drop SDL2_image) is RATIFIED for RELEASE builds (2026-09-21, 14z-173):** applied by `build_release_emulators.sh`, not by `setup_fbneo.sh` — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ratified 2026-09-21 (14z-173) — FBNeo patch 0003".
- **#144: macOS blocks the binaries and right-click > Open does not get past it (2026-09-20, 14z-173);** clearing the quarantine flag works (`PLAY.command` offers it); the player READMEs are written for a non-developer; the applier page ships as a local file, one per release — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — #144 is macOS BLOCKING the binaries".
- **The applied set is DEFLATED and the QSound BIOS member is OPTIONAL (`--no-qsound-bios`) (2026-09-20, 14z-173)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — the applied set is DEFLATED".
- **The deliverables' order, macOS first (2026-09-20, 14z-173):** standalone set, launcher per platform, #144/#145 on clean hosts, README pass, the applier app; macOS and MiSTer are the proof of concept — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — THE DELIVERABLES".
- **The standalone set lands in the RELEASE, not the build (2026-09-20, 14z-173)** — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-20 (14z-173) — the standalone set lands in the RELEASE".
- **The disabled EX route does the no-stock move (2026-09-18, refined 2026-09-19):** the tenants' vs2 EX input is read as its sub-pattern at every stock level; Pyron's 623+PP is the ES move with a stock and the normal move without — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-169) — the disabled EX route does the NO-STOCK move" and "Ruled 2026-09-19 (14z-170) — Pyron's 2623+PP with stock reads NATURALLY".
- **The 0x52 fix is scoped S1 (2026-09-18, 14z-169):** Phobos's two trap remaps stay on the solo track only — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-169) — the class-0x52 fix is scoped".

- **The tenants' Dark Force (2026-09-18, 14z-168):** vsav's Dark Force change with the shells' common rules, each tenant's vs2 startup window and personal Dark Force; compared against the vs2 EX move; the duration stays vsavj's (360/377/360); the tenants' vs2 EX input into the mode on our build is to be disabled — `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` "Ruled 2026-09-18 (14z-168)".

## STANDING PRINCIPLE (maintainer, 2026-08-05): vanilla wins ties

**[VSP-21]** "vsav vanilla is always better when we can." **When a console port and
arcade vsav differ and both would work, take vanilla.** A console port's
choice is not evidence that vanilla is wrong; it is evidence of what that
port's designers preferred.

This is a general rule, not a one-off: the PS1 capture is a reference for
what is POSSIBLE and for data we cannot otherwise obtain (cell placement,
the adjacency of NEW cells), not a style guide for content vsav already
defines. Paired with the maintainer's other statement — "as long as we can
select characters it's good" — the test is: does keeping vanilla still let
the feature work? If yes, keep vanilla.

Applied immediately, twice:
- **`Bishamon DL` and `Aulbath DR` stay vanilla** (Anakaris / Sasquatch).
  PS1 sets both to "no move"; neither is needed for reachability, so
  vanilla stands.
- **Horizontal wrap stays vanilla.** Vsav wraps left/right (cell `0x01`
  Left goes to `0x05`, measured and confirmed in-emulator); the PS1 report
  of "no wrapping" reflects untested extremes. We touch none of those
  cells, so nothing to decide.

Judgment applied under the same rule, open to veto: the three inbound edges
from `0x0B` (`D`/`DL`/`DR` into the new row) DO diverge from vanilla, and
strictly they are not required — Phobos and Donovan are already reachable
via `Bishamon D` and `Aulbath D`, and Pyron through them. They are kept
because without them, pressing Down on the cell directly above the new row
does nothing while three medallions are visible below it, which is the UX
failure "as long as we can select characters" is meant to exclude. Dropping
them would reduce the legacy footprint from 5 bytes to 2.

## Decisions pending (human)

Only undecided items live here; a ruling moves its entry to `DECISIONS_HISTORY.md` in the
commit that records it (CLAUDE.md [VSP-17]).

## THE DEADNESS REGISTER (opened 14z-71, maintainer's standing instruction)

**[VSP-23]** Every claim of the form **"legacy never reaches this, so we may reuse
it"**. Each is measured by ABSENCE, which is the weakest kind of evidence
we accept, so each is listed here with its guard. **These are the FIRST
PLACES TO CHECK for any unexplained regression in vanilla assets, engine
behaviour or rendering** — before anything else is suspected.

| Reused resource | Claim | Guard | Fallback if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~palette-seq ids 0x1E-0x21 (`0x39ACC0`)~~ **CLAIM FALSE, ROW WITHDRAWN 14z-79 (they are Bulleta's DF block)** | vanilla only ever requests 0x26/0x27 | `tests/audit_palette_seq_ids.sh` (10,504 sampled calls) | none — the palette path never transits work RAM, so the audit is the ONLY guard |
| effect-class row 16 (`0x080AEC`) | vanilla never dispatches class 16 | `tests/audit_effect_class_rows.sh` §1, 0 reads over every frame of six replays vs a 3,872-hit control (14z-197; 1,760 on the old clock's part-replays) | none needed: the row was a stub (`rts`), so a wrong claim costs at most the old no-op |
| ~~drawer list-type 6 (`0x01B6AA`)~~ **CLAIM FALSE (measured 14z-89) — LEGACY LISTS DO REACH TYPE 6** | vanilla has no type-6 sprite lists | `audit_effect_class_rows.sh` §1/§4 + `tests/test_beam_list_type6.sh` | **THE FALLBACK HELD — this is what a safe-and-loud design buys.** 14z-89 measured the tripwire ARMED on legacy content on huitzil-m13: `21_don_mash` 387 times and `26_don_arcade_mash` 948 times, PC-attributed to inside the thunk body (0x0FD060). Rendering stayed correct throughout (the fallback runs vsav's own type-6 code, reproduced instruction-for-instruction), so nothing rendered wrong and no playtest ever saw it — exactly the outcome the register's "prefer designs where being wrong is safe and loud" rule was written for. WHY IT WAS MISSED: the deadness measurement was sound but its COVERAGE was four replays (`02/07/09/30`), and the gate has always run on that default set; the two replays that arm it are long mash/arcade rigs nobody pointed it at. COST TODAY: `$FF010C/$FF010D` is a live work-RAM counter vanilla does not keep, so both replays diverge permanently from the vanilla masked basis — they are `.pending` on huitzil-m13 pending the maintainer's ruling. ~~OPEN: does the fallback need to stop counting (make the tripwire diagnostic-only / move it out of work RAM), or is the counter acceptable? See "Decisions pending — 14z-89"~~ **ANSWERED 14z-91: the counter was REMOVED** — the `beam_list_type6` `RAM:$FF010C` counter deleted, which cleared all six `.pending` legacy replays (`HANDOFF.md` Build registry, the 14z-91 row (C)) |

**[VSP-22]** Rules for adding a row: the claim must be measured with a POSITIVE CONTROL
on the same instrument and leg (a blind instrument and a real zero look
identical — paid for three times in 14z-71); it must name its guard; and
it must say what happens if the claim is wrong. Prefer designs where being
wrong is *safe and loud* over designs that are merely well-measured.
